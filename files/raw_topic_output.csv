0,10,Read analysis from the debate here: http://on.wsj.com/4dXYPe6
1,10,I'm sick of debates where the debaters don't answer the questions they were supposed to.
2,-1,Trump 2024!
3,24,Funny how his biggest fear is that his beloved guns get taken away...
4,-1,"C'mon Donald ... Duck. She has a plan : let the FED print more money to ""save"" the economy. It will work , look at how GREAT Joe Biden did ! He is such a lovely guy look at how he is around little children , he just loves those 😡🤬!"
5,-1,"For anyone interested, timestamps of the debate that Josh Johnson talks about in his video ""They’re Eating WHAT? Another Debate Debacle"": 31:35 Kamala on people leaving his rallies early, followed by trump immediately responding to it, followed by... 33:16 ""...they're eating the DAWGS!"" + kamala laughing in his face 1:22:18 ""And THIS ... ... former president..."" (invited the taliban to camp David) 1:30:42 First question about medical plan 1:32:32 Second question about medical plan and subsequent ""I have concepts of a plan."""
6,17,Trump!
7,7,"I like how incredibly weak Trump's comment on climate change was, not talking about climate change or how to stop it in any way, instead dissing other countries and biden, like usual. A bit too much emphasis was put on 'improving manufacturing' in both responses, considering that that's one of the big reasons for climate change"
8,23,14:33-14:38 🎉😂 surprise it’s for his company
9,1,Vote for kamala!!!!
10,20,"'Excuse me, excuse me, I have to respond. Another lie' 😂😂😂😂"
11,25,He hates hel. Lol
12,24,"Has anyone seen spot? He's missing. My neighbors are grilling out, I think ill go ask them if they have seen him. ."
13,-1,Lord help us poor folk and this country. It is very sad for me to think that these are our best people we have to pick from.
14,3,She still has not answered the 1st question she was ask. 🤔🤣Also i can feel this slug out. A few low blows.
15,20,"every time you tell a lies, you will swallow your own spit"
16,12,i’m
17,27,Vote for Trump!
18,2,"Now I listen to the people that lived in Springfield and they were talking about the people who had 15,000 food stamps when they go to the store those were people that was brought here and food vouchers to purchase housing they were talking about the Haitians that was placed here by the government so when you hear Trump saying they're eating the pets he's not talking the legal Haitians because he never talked about Haitians in the past eating animals so someone trying to put Trump saying is the Haitians but he never said that"
19,12,"Ada indikasi zelensky menyelewengkan atau menikmati berbagai bantuan militer bersama-sama dengan biden untuk kepentingan pribadi mereka dengan mengorbankan rakyat dan tentara ukraina. Hal ini dapat dilihat dari banyaknya bantuan militer yang dikerahkan keukraina yang pada akhirnya tidak menghasilkan apapun. Mereka hanya bisa memperlambat tentara rusia, namun tidak pernah ada hasil yang memuaskan bagi ukraina. olehnya itu kita semua patut menduga bahwa bantuan tersebut hanya sebagian yang sampai di Ukraina. Selain itu terlihat pula dari tingginya upaya teror dan penembakan terhadap lawan politiknya. Mungkinkah mereka takut diaudit...???"
20,0,I think Harris has similarities with Biden
21,23,"😮 1:26:02 , 1:26:10 not good but he’s older and wiser"
22,-1,This is sooo funny getting high watching this is a pure joy 😹🤣😂

30,1,Kamala claims Russia would invade Poland. Russia would never invade NATO
31,-1,Its funny how she use her sad voice to make a point.. 👿👿
32,0,Trump is the powerful weapon.but Harris is the copypost Joe Biden 😂
33,9,I love jubilee
34,15,The proof is in the pudding - the country was better when Trump was president
35,1,"Wow she all the questions ,she stands up there and lies. NO FACT CHECKING KAMALA"
36,23,1:00:04
37,-1,"How about a debate where each candidate has their own set of questions for the other and they themselves ask the question. The moderators would just be there to be time keepers…allowing the same amount of time back and forth, tell them when time was up and when the next question was, along with a mic silence to stop them from talking over each other. This way the opponents can grill the other and not allow the other to skirt around the question. This also greatly reduces the likelihood of the candidates knowing what questions would be asked of them and would show what topics are important to them. kamala would be destroyed."
38,12,Pag tarong ug tabi CAMALA oie... HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH

45,-1,Have followed American political span and honestly speaking . Trump should never be president that's my view
46,-1,Incredibly entertaining!
47,19,She sent him off the deep end @ 31:45. He was a wild animal after that.
48,0,"As a Romanian I need to correct Mrs Harris, we’re not happy Trump wasn’t re-elected. The current president is an absolute disaster and we do not trust Harris one bit."
49,1,"Kamala needs to go ALL THE WAY IN ON TRUMP, and compare her views as opposed to his.. stop being nice.. treat this like a battle rap put him to sleep"
50,8,"The silence on the right everytime hypocritical and false information was spat out from the left. You can tell it has grown on him. What a colossal failure from the left. No backing up, no truth and no respect. Can't even answer questions 😭 It's terrifying . Almost like everyone is going against Trump as a logical, polite and respectful American. But we know that this is all part of Gods will and plan, that ""For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all."" 2nd Cor. 4:17 meaning that God is putting us through these hard tims to prove to us that there is something far greater that he opened to us through His suffering on the cross. Believe in Jesus and trust him in all your works. Do not back down for: ""Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him."""
51,3,"Trump negotiated a deal with Taliban that stopped our soldiers from getting sniped and she was mad about that, shows you how much she cares about our soldiers"
52,15,"trump may be crazy, but he's real funny"
53,1,I can feel the Kamala painful voice during make the lie.

62,2,They eat our pets because they are all in the shelter smh.
63,22,"She hasnt done anything as VP, what more as president."
64,2,They have said that about the missing animals
65,-1,Y'all really making me choose to get away from the politicians they wanna assassinate Trump and she hasn't done anything nor has Biden

72,8,Thanks for entertainment Yankees. Love from India🇮🇳
73,23,55:13 Says the one who thinks for his whole life 2020 was stolen…
74,18,It is funny that they presented her 'winner' of this debate smirking around to the things democrats did (that they are doing all over the world) and using the political allegations against Trump that they created out of thin air...
75,7,"As someone who’s not from the U.S., I just wanted to learn more about the policies the candidates are offering but instead I ended up watching an hour and a half of bickering 🥲"
76,12,I am Indian
77,19,Love the way she keeps looking at him to see if she’s getting under his skin and he’s cool as a cucumber
78,-1,Best thing would have been letting Steve Harvey mediate this debate😂😂🤣🤣
79,-1,"Congress must pass laws to put a cap on campaign spending and donations. Money can not define a candidates ability to be a Senator, Congress person, President or any Governor or Mayor. Soros is pouring millons of dollars to defeat Ted Cruz. This should be illegal."
80,0,"6:31 ""Vice president Harris, you and president Trump where elected 4 years ago"" ...huh?"
81,-1,"What does anyone expect from the usual predictable mudslinging on display that does little or nothing to convey anything meaningful about diverging policies and ideas on how to run / govern the US ? It is more like a democratic circus, a show and the people are being fed some selected crumbs to digest and be happy with. No matter what they say , both Republicans and Democrats are beholden to their corporate paymasters and will keep doing their bidding, no one cares about the plight of the blue or white collar American worker whose jobs have been shed like crazy overseas and who may nowadays even hold 3 - 4 jobs just to hold his head above water and keep paying those lovely bills."
82,-1,Let’s get started with the open question. You and president trump were elected 4 years ago.
83,-1,#TRUMP2024THECEOPRESIDENT
84,-1,"If Kamala wants to do all this change, WHY hasn't she already under Biden? she supports Biden yet wont do what she says she will IF ELECTED! ALL LIES!"
85,1,"Kamala keeps saying to Trump to stop the name calling yet she was the one who started the name calling and bashing of her opponent and continued it throughout, then tries to play the mature one by calling him out on it!"
86,15,Trump was doing well until the rallies. The train went off the rails for him after that. lol
87,9,King Trump👑❤
88,-1,I didn't know America was a country I thought it was an entertainment channel

90,-1,"What the fudge, how he claim debunkin charlottesville!!! We live here...he is sad"
91,22,Time to let a woman run the nation.💚
92,1,"Just as the mods introduce the candidates, you hear a woman’s voice say sharply, “Don’t!” off screen. You see the female mod blink a bit in response; she heard it, too. As it is that audible, it must be Kamala, who should be the only woman close enough to the stage and AV stuff to pick up.Why was she saying “Don’t!” ?"

112,-1,"I love this rally people were so enthusiastic at my beloved Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, where I attended many Islander games. And for those who think that Trump is talking through his hat about winning New York, in the last gubernatorial race, Lee Zeldin lost to Kathy Hochul by only five points. He is absolutely an underdog in the state, but it's not inconceivable that he could pull out an upset."
113,-1,Awesome
114,8,Make America Great again 🙏God Bless USA 🙏✝️🌹❤️
115,11,❤God Bless President Donald Trump 🙏❤️🌹✝️
116,14,"- - Trump is a deeply unpleasant individual whose absence would be a relief to many. Trump & Jdv, 2 pathological liars continue to weave web of intricate deceits that it becomes their second nature. As a 30 yr vet & a GOP for 5 decades, I WILL VOTE as a democrat for the 1st time & until trump’s cult is gone!"

121,-1,What the actual f did I just watch?
122,-1,The fact that laughing hyena Kamala Harris was vice presidentand now a prospective President of the USA makes me really wonder about current democracy .
123,-1,"In Trump's debate with Kamala, she was not able to produce any plans at all for what she would do. KAMALA HARRIS DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. What was weird was her running up to Trump at the debate. It looked like she was attacking him. What a weirdo."
124,-1,America Automobile industry is best Car bilding My favourite are Mustang JEEP CHEROKEE and DODGE DART THE ONE OF THE BEST IS OLSMOBILE CUTTLAS VARIANT WITH all data computerss ....
125,-1,"As a woman, and I've been hearing other women claim that women should support and uplift other women yet I'm not feeling very supported by other women about my freedom of choice and my freedom of speech. Kamala does not speak for me and she definitely does not have my vote. She's a terrible VP, she was a terrible District attorney, she has done absolutely nothing to benefit American and the people living here legally. She was absolutely nominated by Joe Biden as the Border Czar to which she chose to do nothing and let in all those unvetted illegal immigrants. The same illegal immigrants that she claims are not criminals. The same immigrants who are bringing in drugs that are killing our children. The same illegal immigrants who are beating, raping and killing our innocent women and children. I fully stand with Trump to win this next election. Trump 2024 🎉"
126,-1,BEST PRESIDENT EVER!!! I love love love President Trump!!
127,-1,He should start off every speech with and no tax on overtime.

150,-1,But someone's changed Alexa and now it says he's alive and well
151,-1,"I really don't believe that the people in this country want a former hooker, street walker running this country"
152,-1,Trump had eighty nine million people following him on social media and I believe they all voted for him so if the numbers are correct Biden only got seventeen million votes when the powers that be placed him in the white house
153,-1,Trump didn't lose any election and the truth is Biden used the dead and a switch artist who switched the names over the votes think about it Trump had over seventy million votes there was only one hundred and six million voters to start with so that means Biden could have had thirty six million votes unless the dead came back to life
154,-1,Terrific ideaNo Tax on overtime AND No Tax on tips!!!A positive candidate who tells the truth andTruly Trump willMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
155,7,This is the first time we are hearing real numbers on the illegal immigrants who have come through the border all of the others are telling us lies

188,0,The anchor at the debate was Harris sorority sister. Disgusting!
189,8,god bless.
190,2,"Ok, you want to know what a racist agenda is? If you're watching this and you don't see it you had better open up your eyes. Number one the Haitian immigrants in Springfield ""are not illegal"". Springfield requested them to immigrate 2/3 time because they had a 30,000 Delta population drop since the 90s. There are vacant houses, vacant apartment buildings, and the loss of tax revenue. 15000 Haitians came to Springfield in 2020. They shop at the supermarket, there kids go to the local schools, they go to the local churches, they work in the local industries. You know just like anybody else that moves to a new place. Now here is the racist trope that is the norm throughout American history. He made an unfounded claim about them eating people's pets and look like a complete moron during the debate. Then he turned around and now it went from eating pets to raping and sodomizing your daughters? Those scary immigrant black men deflowering your daughters 🤨 do they do that before or after they eat the family dog 🤔. Sensations are black are they taking black jobs 🤔. Do I believe that somebody in Springfield started that meme about Haitians eating pets? Yes very recently a Haitian man wrecked into the back of a school bus, this caused the injury of 25 kids and the tragic death of one. Springfield is predominantly white it always has been. People moved out and didn't move back so the average age is like 65. There's not really a whole lot there. There's a dollar tree, a wendy's, KFC, a gas station and a tractor supply in a Goodwill. There are a few manufacturing plants... but that's about it. There's only about 60,000 residents plus the 15000 ""legal"" immigrants. Now when the accident happened, the man responsible got 12 years convicted for manslaughter. But then you have racist people in every community and it only takes one. Trump is a piece of s***. What he does is give you a boogie man. He gives you a reason to hate regardless if that's something even exists. Then he points a finger in a group that is not like you. So why does he do that? It is because hate is the strongest emotion that we have. It is also the easiest State of mind to manipulate someone. In 2015 during his campaign it was Mexicans. End of the campaign it was Hillary. Then it was China. Then it was black lives matter protesters. After the debate it was Haitians eating your pets. What I said was by the time we get closer to the election it's going to be cannibal immigrants living in the sewer eating alligators...😳. I was wrong he went right to Jim Crow era racist propaganda and now Haitians are raping and sodomizing your daughters 😳. Every time he points the finger violence ensues. There were a group of proud boys in Springfield today, marching and saying some racist s***. Wish I would have known about it while it was happening. Trump is a piece of s***. Do sloppy, he's slow,, he's dim-witted, he's racist, if you can't see that, that says more about you than anyone else. If you don't see anything wrong with what he says in the path of mental bread crumbs that he is leaving... It's probably because you're the same as him, and that is not a compliment, I can't think of a worse thing to say about someone.Let's be clear, his slogan ""make America great again""? Let him just be honest for once and is f**** life and call it what it is, ""make America HATE again"".Republicans could have had back anyone and the GOP chose this POS as their candidate 🤦🏻... But it was going to be DeSantis or Trump, same smell, same look, sitting in the same toilet bowl... It would not have made a difference. Sad part is they're actually good Republicans out there that you could have nominated, supported and backed. And you don't want to go with this piece of s***🤬?F Trump. Those scales are going to balance. And I'll let you in on a little secret the GOP doesn't want Trump to be president they want Vance to be president because Vance will do what he's told. Problem is nobody would vote for Vance cuz nobody knew who the hell he was until a few years ago. But you get Trump on the same ticket and something happens to Trump and ..I'm thinking final destination moment. There's already been two strikes. Does it matter what he does from here on out there's going to be more."
191,-1,"The bad luck began for Donald Trump when he let his marriage to Ivana Trump hit the skids for a bimbo.Why even after she reappeared he turned to her for advise she had brains that girl! she'd have been a greater asset than the beautiful Spinx he's married to now , rest in peace beautiful ill fated Ivana."
192,1,I'm keeping an open mind. Would someone steer me to an equivalent public address by Kamala?

The question is: Do the American people truly understand what has happened over the past three years under Biden and Harris (the ‘Kalamazoo copycat’)? They have damaged American society, dismantled its foundations, and contributed to global chaos, empowering terrorist organizations and creating turmoil. In the first debate with Trump last week, the ‘Kalamazoo copycat’ delivered only empty rhetoric, flip-flopping on her positions, while continuing the same lies and corruption that defined her time in California.I also agree with former President Donald Trump—there’s no point in wasting time with the Kalamazoo copycat in a second-round debate, orchestrated by the mainstream media’s fake news outlets like ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN. These liberal media channels are anti-Trump and are working to sabotage your 2024 presidential campaign. In fact, the liberal mainstream media has fueled more chaos, violence, hatred, and division in American society than ever before, especially since the Obama years, 2016, and beyond. That’s why I oppose a second debate with the Kalamazoo copycat on ABC or any other mainstream media platform!"

438,-1,"Tuberville is old and GOP are radical authoritarian CT & CN infiltrated into the fabric of our Democracy. Tuberville, Trump, Vance, MTG, Jim Jordan, Mike Johnson, Alito and others are pushing Christian Nationalist cult ideology where their beliefs & laws are forced on all of us. God did not create the gov’t to be a ‘Christian nation’. That’s crazy talk. Stay out of the rights of women’s bodies, stop threatening arrest, threatening doctors while women die, making up disgusting CT about babies born are executed, that a embryo is a human before a heartbeat that’s science, monitoring girls periods and controlling people’s lives. These dangerous draconian laws & bills Will NOT win you votes. All the Republican Senators running for re election just voted against your right to IVF. They talk about family values, but want in your bedroom & doctor’s offices to monitor and voted NO on your healthcare. Rick Scott, FL but he had a false Ad supporting IVF. Marsha Blackburn, TNJosh Hawley, MOKevin Cramer, NDTed Cruz, TX lied he supported IVFDeb Fischer, NBPete Ricketts, NBRoger Wicker, MSJohn Barrasso, WYJD Vance did not Vote as usual. That was expected. He didn’t vote on Child tax Credit either. Vance has ruined his OH state spewing his conspiracy theory in Springfield. He admitted the CT was to get attention. It caused fear, a lockdown and ruined the city. Vance is Arrogant, inept, misogynist, all in with Project 2025, inexperienced, unfavorable -6% VP in our history. And Vance can someday be president/ dictator when Donnie is Amend 25. 🤔Kamala won the debate hands down 63/37. Trump was a disaster. He had no policies and lame plans bcuz his plans are Project 2025 similar to his Agenda 47. All he did was get hostile and spew insults and crazy Conspiracy theories. Lied 33+ times. If the people are undecided they are a plant or baked in."

She attacked Trump with lie after lie, while tag-teaming him together with both moderators (who are friends with her). Trump was already president, outlined all the Biden Administration's problems, and rightfully described her shortcomings. I can't believe that voters believe a woman this vacuous, can be good for any leadership role. If she gets elected, our country is DONE."

It's not like they are letting in educated rich people who can raise our economy!! Help!"
471,5,"The undecided people are waiting for an ""ok"" to vote for Trump. It's simple. You're voting for democracy or autocracy. Freedom or oppression."

Economy - Push ""America First"" trade policies, with tariffs on countries like China. - Seek more tax cuts for businesses and reduce regulations.3. Foreign Policy - Take a tough stance on China, aim for better relations with Russia. - Withdraw from international agreements he doesn’t like, such as climate deals.-End the war in Russia and Ukraine. 4. Healthcare - Try again to repeal or replace Obamacare. - Lower prescription drug prices.5. Energy and Climate - Focus on boosting oil, gas, and coal production. - Downplay climate change policies.6. Social Issues - Support further restrictions on abortion. - Defend gun rights and oppose stricter gun control laws. 7. Judiciary - Appoint more conservative judges to federal courts.8. Law and Order - Continue tough-on-crime policies and increase support for police.9. Elections - Push for stricter voter ID laws and limit mail-in voting.10. Pandemic Response - Focus on fewer government mandates and more personal freedom regarding public health issues like COVID-19.Trump’s policies would continue his American First approach with a focus on strong borders, economic nationalism, fewer regulations, and conservative social policies. I was Democrat but over the past 3.5 years year watching our nation go straight to hell. I use to dislike Trump but then I really started to research him and what he has done that mainstream media doesn't tell us. Trump was a strong leader when he was president and that is what the United States desperately needs right now."

575,-1,"Per ABC staffer: I have worked for ABC news for over 10 years in various technical and administrative positions. Since the acquisition of ABC news in 1996, I have observed significant transformations in the nature of news reporting at the organization. These changes suggest a shift from unbiased reporting to a model influenced by external factors. For the record, I do not endorse Donald Trump in his capacity as candidate for President of the United States. The intent of this affidavit is to address concerns regarding percieved biases within news reporting within my employer’s debate that will be hosted on September 10, 2024. The Harris campaign received particular accommodations, including, but not limited to, the providing of a podium significantly smaller than that used by Donald Trump, and assurances regarding split-screen television views that would favorably impact Kamala Harris’s appearance relative to Donald Trump. It was agreed that Donald Trump would be subjected to fact-checking during the debate, while Kamala Harris would not face comparable scrutiny. This was widely known throughout the company that Donald Trump would be fact checked. In fact, various people were assigned to fact check observations it was perceived candidate Trump would make during the debate. In fact, Harris campaign required assurances that Donald Trump would be fact checked. This was done via multiple communications with the Harris campaign whereas the Trump campaign was not included in the negotiations. To my understanding, any rules negotiations and conversations pertaining to the debate should have both the Trump and Harris campaign involved, the Harris campaign had numerous more calls regarding the debate rules without the Trump campaign aware or on the call. The Harris campaign was provided with sample questions that, while not the exact questions, covered similar topics that would appear during the debate. Furthermore, the Harris campaign-imposed restrictions on the scope of questioning, including: No questions regarding the perceived health of President Joe Biden. No inquiries related to her tenure as Attorney General of San Francisco. No questions concerning her brother-in-law, Tony West, who faces allegations of embezzling billions of dollars in taxpayer funds and who may be involved in her administration if elected. Internal Organizational Climate: I have observed a pronounced bias against Donald Trump within ABC news. Employees expressing favorable views towards him experience significant concerns about potential retribution. Purpose and Documentation of Affidavit: This affidavit is executed to document and provide transparency regarding the issues of fairness and impartiality in the debate process and broader concerns about journalistic integrity at ABC News. Additionally, for further investigation, I have secretly recorded several conversations that will prove that the Harris Campaign insisted upon not only the Fact Checking of Donald Trump, but also insisted on what questions were not to be asked under any circumstances or else the Harris campaign would decline to participate in the debate. I have sent a certified letter to Speaker Mike Johnson, dated Sept 9th, 2024, to establish a record that the correspondence was sent before the debate commenced."

627,-1,Kamala Harris came better prepared? Or she came already knowing the questions and was told that she was not going to get fact checked! Why did they not confront her on her lies? They lie and try to make it look like Trump was not telling the truth? https://youtu.be/7G0yUP9v-t4?si=UMP0WyfVG8VPwusm Kamala Harris absolutely will band fracking. How do I know? As before the end of the debate she brought up the fake climate change topic again. Her comments about the abortion issue we're also full of crap! Supreme Court sent the issue down to the state level because it was a state's rights issue. Not be taken back up to a federal issue because there is now presidents that it's a stage rights issue. She also talked about the woman's right to her own body! I do believe everyone believes that a woman has the right to her own body. No issue at hand is not her body it's the body that's growing inside of her! DNA test and let's follow the science! DNA of that child will not match the DNA of that mother. But Democrats don't follow science they only follow the lives of their father Satan

Call me whatever you want but I am hopeful and I can't trust Trump for what I have seen but I haven't seen anything yet for Kamala. I am willing to give her a chance. I am voting for her. May the best man win."
632,0,Harris never answered any questions! Especially the first question! Her rehearsed word salad answer does not relate to the question!Trump won!

Under Trump EVERYONE will be better off financially, under Harris EVERYONE will be poorer. Unfortunately most under 40’s now think capitalism is bad and that it’s the reason for the disparity in wealth when in fact it’s the exact opposite. Communism causes the huge disparity in wealth. The middle classes are eliminated with a communist government, everyone has exactly the same, just slightly more than nothing while only a select few are very wealthy. Capitalism provides a ladder for people to climb, with communism there is no ladder, you’re either massively wealthy or poor. Why do you think all the wealthy celebrities are ok with endorsing communism? Because they’ve already made their fortunes and won’t be affected. PLEASE SEE SENSE AND VOTE TRUMP TO SAVE CAPITALISM AND YOUR CHANCE TO CLIMB THE LADDER IN LIFE."

Began lied she did not come from a middle class family and her mother didn't her inner sister by herself.That's a lie. If her lips are moving she's lying. She made the whole thing about her.She said nothing about how she's gonna fix the deficit.She said nothing about closing the borders.She said nothing about removing all of these immigrants but She does want to have our taxpayer dollars.Pay for transgender surgeries for those who are in prison.Nobody told them to change their sex.God gave it to them for a reason not to change it. So why should we pay for their change?Nobody told them to do what they did to break.The law and end up in prison.

699,16,"Since the mods didnt do it I fact-checked both:Harris stated she wasn't trying to take our firearms Fact-check 1: Kamala Harris expressed support for a mandatory gun buyback program in 2019 Trump believes in better control of who is purchasing. Harris stated there was no agenda for late term abortion Fact-check 2: Multiple states have no restrictions on it, a woman can find out late that her child has mental or physical defects and terminate the day of in some states i.e. the Virginia governor in 2019 proposed and advocated for late term and in his own words ""have a discussion with the mother on what to do with the 'child' after it is born"" verbatim. Tim Walz also removed reporting requirements for children who were ""botched abortions"" and left to die. Trump believes in the exceptions such as gr*pe but in early term. Harris stated Trump praised white-supremacist calling them fine people Fact-check 3: the rest of that sentence from Trump (you can look it up) was as follows ""I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally."" Trump was speaking on the people protesting the removal of national monuments who were both for and against it. Harris stated Trump organized J6 Fact-check 4: He didn't organize it, he wasn't even there. He was asked to make a statement and he urged them to be lawful and respectful as it is their right to protest (you can still find these tweets) and no one was armed. It went sideways when the ges ta po began beating the protestors which there is video evidence of. Police did die later and of completely unrelated reasons. Kamala however was there and there's recording of Pelosi saying nah to national guard when it got out of hand. Weird... Also note: She said J6 was the worst moment in American history since the CW the eve of the anniversary of 9/11. Extra weird... Harris blamed Trump for the border issues Fact-check 5: Brandon appointed her in control of the border because of the ""surge of people they needed to move"" knowing their was an influx of ""visitors"". There is also video of this. Trump didnt turn down the border law, Republicans refused it because it came with ""deviled details"" that instructed anyone who DOES cross cannot be detained so in essence they were trying to be sneaky and the Center of Immigration reported Bidens deal would do nothing if not make it worse. Trump tried to build a wall, Harris stated it wouldn't do anything to help, now she wants to build the wall all of a sudden. Strange. Bonus: Harris stated all the corrupt politicians that worked for Trump whom he fired now support her. This is true. And Walz family, Harris own father, and a good chunk of the Democrat and Independent party now support Trump creating the Unity Party."
700,2,Enough. “They are eating your dogs!!” was the worst piece of propagandist drivel ever uttered by an American presidential candidate. Mr Trump screamed it on National TV while losing a debate. That was it for me. Voting blue for Country and decency.🇺🇸💙
701,-1,It's a darn shame but it seems like the US is definitely on a downward spiral. What in the world makes Kamala Harris qualified as commander in chief?

807,10,"Trump said that the audience went crazy over what he was saying at the debate. Let me know if you can hear an audience, because, THERE WASN'T AN AUDIENCE. So, this is the guy you want to lead our country? Do you care so little about the USA that you'd feel OK with this old man, who is losing his mind, to be in charge, to be commander in chief of our military?"
808,-1,It was the first time the American people saw a clown get crushed so badly!! 😂

835,11,im back said TRUMP. 😊😊
836,-1,That first lady contradicted herself
837,-1,Kamala didn’t even answer the first question in the debate. Kamala’s policy is based on hope. So why has it not worked for 3.5 years? Do you really want to risk the nation on her incompetence?
838,-1,"the thoghts of anyone watching that 3 against one debate and some how crownning kamalla the winner ? she never said what her policies where (but we kno already from the last 3.5 years , flood the boarder , start wars , give trillions to other countries and leave us in debt and inflation , the world is dumping our dollar and they still wanna blame trump??? shesh"

847,-1,Harris kamala is lying to everyone I can see ot on her eyes
848,26,Team trump 2024 👇👇
849,0,"Harris is a scarecrow like Biden, there is no difference between these two people, Obama and the 40 thieves of the Democratic Party are the puppeteers of this game. Believe me, every day they stay in power in the United States is war and political and economic turmoil, chaos and chaos at the borders, and the seizure of power by supporters of terrorists and groups like Hamas. The situation of gatherings You have seen these in American universities and on the streets. There has never been a precedent in American history for burning the flag of the Congress building."
850,22,She has NO plans ! Allshe knows how to do is lie to try and shift the blame to trump ! She and hillery are in the same sinking boat
851,0,Harris had earrings that were microphones
852,-1,"I'll answer for kamala. Free enterprise and corporate greed are behind the increases in the cost of living. Covid gave them the opportunity to start gouging the buying public, whether it's fuel, food, or the cost of homes rent you name it. It has little to do with who was president at the time. As long as the private industry can inflate prices and make packaging smaller, we the buying public will continue to be gouged . My suggestion to whoever takes over the White House is to find a solution to stopping corporations from their greedy habits."
853,1,"Honey, Kamala never answered a question directly. She does word salad"
854,7,What policies?
855,0,You will walk us right into communism with Harris
856,5,"Not a citizen then you have NO right to vote. Voting is a privilege to US citizens, not illegals!"
857,13,Wow you couldn't have put together a bigger bunch of clowns.trump 2024
858,-1,We were energy independent under Trump. The Petro $ was weakened by the reversal of Trumps energy policy by Biden/Harris. This policy also drove up fertilizer prices and transportation costs. This also happened under Obama 2007- 2008. While at the same time increasing the money supply and expanding the deficit by trillions. I have not heard Kamala speak about this issue. Food inflation will get worse if they don't stop the destruction of Ukraine. Grain and natural gas will be taken off the Global market. And up goes the prices.
859,4,Karmela?
860,-1,The guy said he was happy with her policy plan? I didn’t hear any policy plans.
861,0,"Also, Harris lied about everything. Trump was right on point didn’t beat around the bush and came straight at you. That’s what I like about President Trump. And I will be voting for Trump."
862,2,To the last guy that spoke about the animals being eaten. I never knew that. I’m glad President Trump brought it up now I know. Sick sick minds.
863,29,Watching from Ireland. Please Please vote blue. We are appauled by Trump.
864,0,The woman who said Harris was in office for four years and did nothing obviously doesn’t have the slightest clue what the role of a vice president is. People with such a low knowledge of our country’s government really aren’t equipped to vote. I’m serious. It’s sad she can even vote. She should be taking a civics class prior to voting.
865,-1,"Kamala Harris on the ""cloud"" , ""It's on your laptop, and it's then therefore up here in this cloud, that exists above us, right? It's no longer in a physical place"". Kamala's grasp of geopolitical events , ""Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically that's wrong."" Wow ......just wow !!!!! You can either vote for the first Black/Indian Woman President or Someone that can lead this country !"
866,-1,He had 4 yrs in office to fix the border problem yet left it for the next administration
867,-1,Trickle Down Economic is a failed Policy LADIES. TRUMP vision is more Trickle Down Approach. Harris plan appear to be give back to Working Class Americans and let them build up the Economy. Her plan is to let the Wealth trickle up from the American People's than just given LARGE TAX CUTS THAT'S ONLY benefitting the top 5%. Republicans Trickle Down Economics hasn't benefitted the working class..
868,-1,this first interviewer is dumb. Trashing Trump doesn't answer the questions. Harris didn't answer the questions as she is an economic illiterate. As for eating other people pets people came on tv and actually said that this was happening. So as for the one who thought it was moronic he needs to listen more carefully as it was in direct correlation to illegal migrants invading a community and doing bad things.
869,-1,"Everyone needs to be viewing More Perfect Union Podcast clips. View each segment of Gas / Oil, Food and Housing / Rental price fitting. Greed, Collusion and Price Gouging. DOJ IS NOW INVESTIGATING THIS CORRUPTION / DISHONEST BEHAVIOR. These people's received Billions in GOP Tax Cuts and Stimulus Funding."
870,1,"Trump spoke extemporaneously from his brain, whereas Kamala has no brain, apparently, and did nothing but rehearse a script 2024."
871,-1,Do people know how the government works?
872,1,Kamala Harris is a liar on every level ! Fact.
873,3,Trump proved himself 2016 she didnt not one question dumb man
874,1,Kamala is a puppet on a string for obama this is the reason she doesnt answer questions she is told not to because she is a puppet only that
875,29,These people that vote blue are the stupidist people in the world
876,2,All true about people eating pets
877,-1,U want something new u will if shes elected u will have communisum
878,1,Kamala is a communist
879,-1,Maybe that woman can explain what Kamala is going to do for her. A rock has more brain substance.
880,7,What about Trump's policies?
881,1,"Mrs. Kamala Harris is a free-spirited, decisive, and first-class leader."
882,22,The first woman was redicoulus. Saying that a VP can make a difference in policies is redicoulus and ignorant. These people seemed to have forgotten what economy the orange clown left during Covid whilst people dieing.
883,3,Karmala still has done nothing she has not been to the boarder. She is a liar.
884,1,Kamala lost the debat
885,-1,Trump has found the bottom of the DUMB Barrel as voters.

889,1,Anyone voting for Kamala has an IQ of 80 or less
890,22,"Lol. ""She could have been doing all these things for the last four.... Or however long..."" The average American voter thinks a VP can just do whatever they want to and I guess Congress is meaningless? Absolute morons. We should need an IQ test to vote. What an embarrassment."
891,2,Do some research! They are eating pets!
892,-1,these people are living bots in society
893,0,VOTE HARRIS. VOTE COMMUNISM. THEN YOU VOTE FOR CHINA
894,1,Kamala is a puppet of military complex and it's puppets biden adm and democratic party and all warmongers Stop all wars vote Trump
895,-1,White liberals are idiots
896,-1,What did trump ever do for us?
897,1,Kamala Yes or NoLife is just Not that simple Kamala
898,-1,"She won because she ""Trashed Trump"". Pennsylvania is full of morons. Now I understand why the race is close in this state."
899,22,"To the people that think vice president can do things, Your wrong she has a boss! That'll be the president"
900,10,Hard to find this debate lol

907,7,"Um I'm sorry, and I don't want to get attacked, but didn't immigrants literally build this country? Like the Europeans in the 1700s and all the immigrants that came in during the Gilded Age literally built these big cities. The physically built this country and now he's saying they are ruining it? Sorry not how that works Trump."
908,10,I felt that the whole debate was controlled and Trump was cut off several times when we was speaking.
909,-1,I’m wondering if liberals genuinely believe they’re not a bunch of stupid shit eaters
910,-1,"She sounds like an Obama mistake., Why hasn't VP Kamala done anything in 3 1/2 years as VP. Also, only crazy people makes the faces she makes, i.e. nut cases. She did nothing in 3 1/2 years plain scumbag."
911,-1,".Why hasn't VP Kamala done anything in 3 1/2 years as VP. Also, only crazy people makes the faces she makes, i.e. nut cases."
912,-1,"Adults don’t care about Taylor Swift. Also, the fact that Trump is even considered a nominee for president in the first place, is just a disgrace to our country. Then considering he actually won speaks to how few Americans value our democracy and their votes.. I want our country to focus on EDUCATION. It would eliminate most republicans (we all know they’re dumb) and improve every single issue greatly. The more people are aware and informed the quicker we can implement the necessary changes our country DESPERATELY needs. Like universal healthcare, livable wages, gun control, environmental protection, and so so many more that are of the most important!! These issues cannot be pushed to the back burner any longer. They affect every one of us on a daily basis and they need to be addressed, NOW!"
913,15,"Trump, your a total idiot .... You have NO EDUCATION, NO MILITARY EXPERIENCE, NO GOVERNMENT POLICIESYou FAIL BADLY"
914,-1,IT'S CALLED FREEDOM OF SPEECH .

TALK TO YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER ABOUT THIS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND DOUGHTER IS FALLING APART . YEARS AGO A DAUGHTER COULD ALWAYS DEPEND ON HER MOTHER . WE'RE MOVING THE TIME OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH
919,16,"IF YOU'ER GOING TO HAVE A BABY TODAY WHY NOT DONATE IT TO A HOSPITAL. SOME WOMAN WILLING TO ABOPT THAT BABY SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE BABIES , RATHER THEN DESTROY A HUMAN LIFE. I DON'T BELIEVE TI'S THE GOVEMMENT'S RESPONSILITY IF YOU GET PREGNEN ."
920,-1,IN MY DAYS WOMAN DID NOT GET PREGNENT IF YOU CAME FROM A GOOD HOME IT WAS VERY RARY . YOU WOULD CONSUMMATE THE MARRIAGE ON YOUR HONEYMOON . THAT MEANS YOU WOULD BE MARRYING A VIRIN. IF YOU LOVE THE YONG LADY YOU WOULD RESPECT HER WISHES .
921,-1,THEY 'RE TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI
922,8,GO TO CHURCH AND PRAY THAT DONALD TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT AGAIN . GOOD LUCK
923,1,"You can see Kamala getting frustrated. It's like she's trying to have an intelligent debate against a spilt child. Its very hard to win an argument against a clever person, its nearly impossible to win against a moron!"
924,17,Jason Momoa for president!
925,10,"Wtf have politics become. I’m not talking about the debate, I’m talking about the comments 😭"
926,-1,Who gives af what Taylor Swift thinks 😂

929,3,i like her compassion
930,-1,Look at she is posing like an actress. She is proving she is like a baby
931,-1,Love how I watched this and the next recommend video is gayshlat moments part 3.
932,3,She was handed the questions. Never has she shown any articulation without a weird answer and a cackle. Are we supposed to believe she is now a completely different person? No
933,-1,The biggest mistake is to host the debate and moderated by liberals from ABC but then Trump get handle all this.
934,1,It's already been exposed. Kamala was wired.
935,-1,Yall cant even equalize the audio?
936,3,She did not rat him for lunch. All she did was show that she is just like Biden. DO people not see how life is today. I'm the poorest I've ever been.
937,-1,"The fact that these two are main candidates, super sad. I’m voting third party."
938,0,And we the people don't want to hear any more Harris's lies
939,13,Zaddy Trump 2024
940,-1,Can’t even admit he lost in 2020. Conservatives your candidate represents you! Is this who you want representing you?
941,1,The only accomplishment Kamala has made is in getting ahead by giving it.
942,0,"Trump just needs to get in office and keep his racist remarks to himself. We all seen it not long ago, the man had the country in a good place, life was affordable he will do it again. Yall just don't like him because he made some sounds with his mouth that you didn't agree with and chose to let it effect the way you feel. Harris is only going to get votes because she's ""black"" and because she's a woman. Those are her strongest attributes and that's it."
943,0,What's historic about a handshake? They literally always shake hands at literally every debate.And Harris wouldn't have any more power to do anything that she doesnt already have the power to do with Biden. Vote Harris if happy with the way things are now and Trump if you don't like how things are going.
944,-1,If you vote for Kamala (a current sitting vice president) expecting to see all these changes she’s talking about. You’re a special kind of stupid.

This “journalist“ must have watched a different debate than I did. Trump won hands down while Karmela avoided answering the question with many salad words. Please, dear Lord, not her for President.Harris the prosecutor takes on classic Trump in debateSusan PageUSA TODAYIt was Classic Trump versus Prosecutor Harris.Despite all the advice former President Donald Trump got beforehand − that he should attack Vice President Kamala Harris on policy and avoid getting personal − the debater who showed up in Philadelphia on Tuesday night was the familiar Trump.He hurled insults, shouted and used more oxygen defending his record than questioning his opponent’s proposals.Harris stayed on offense through almost all the debate, hosted by ABC News, displaying her experience as a prosecutor in California.She managed to make many of the exchanges not about her flip-flops on policy or the record of the Biden administration but about Trump and his history.Again and again, Trump took the bait when she needled him about the size of his rallies, his criminal conviction on felony charges, his handling of the COVID- 19 pandemic and his reputation among world leaders.“You were fired by 81 million people,” she told him.She said his failure to acknowledge that he lost the 2020 election could indicate he didn’t have “the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact,” which she called “deeply.""EDIT: Should any members of this group still subscribe to your local newspaper, I strongly urge all of you to consider doing the following:1. Write to the editor your concerns the lies written in this article expressing your disgust and concerns. Keep in mind, do not be disrespectful in any manner, but instead choose courtesy and respect.2. Cancel your subscription.

975,-1,"Now, It is within the realm of possibility that somebody somewhere had been eating something they shouldn’t be eating. I won’t blame them because inflation is high under Biden/Kamala.

1000,16,Kamala is deceiving people on abortion. The law is with states now and the people are voting. Vote Trump for great economy and strong border.
1001,0,How can you be undecided after seeing 4yrs of Trump and 3.5yrs of Harris? Trump all the way
1002,5,There is no such thing as a undecided voter. They lie
1003,9,Performance❤ djt
1004,3,These women are idiots im sorry I had to say it smh
1005,0,"Harris winning the debate only keeps her competitive in the race, nothing more and nothing less. Vote 💙."
1006,-1,I think a lot of these people really wanna vote for Trump they just don’t want to say it so they kinda do it in a roundabout way but I know it didn’t change my mind. I didn’t really learn anything new. He’s fucking insane. How can you not figure that out from that debate.
1007,5,"This election is a global election because the actions of the US Deep state dramatically affects the rest of the world. If you are an 'Undecided', then when you visit the ballot box on election day, please think of the rest of us who cannot vote, and vote for Donald Trump on our behalf."
1008,5,Most of these people who are undecided are just stupid
1009,3,Abc gave her the questions ahead of time.
1010,1,"Fake kamala, Liar kamalaFools stupids with her words & actingWillie Brown Puppiet"
1011,0,"Harris thinks she's winning. The fact that there are a lot of undecided voters potentially not voting for either one will harm Harris more than Trump, whose base has survived a rather unfair debate. If I were Harris, I'd be very restless. And in some of the swing states, despite the debate, Trump is still leading, however small his lead is. Not good... Trump 2024"
1012,-1,Do these people not understand what will happen to that country if that lunatic is re-elected? Too many lazy low IQ voters.
1013,-1,these peopoles dont eveny care about themshelf. they only got themshelf in the circle........they should leave the country asap
1014,14,The US Judicial and Executive systems are powerless against a dangerous criminal like Donald Trump. A person who committed treason by supporting and inciting the Jan 6 riots has trampled badly on the US Constitution. The American people are unfortunate to have an immoral leader like Donald Trump. It is impossible to elect a man who is too dangerous to democracy and immoral to become a leader of a great power like the United States of America.
1015,14,"Donald Trump, an immoral person, the world's most lying leader, the most shameful former US President in US history."
1016,5,"Those who do not know who to vote for have not seen the current reality that our country is living in a state of economic recession, crimes, illegal immigrants in the US enjoy many health insurance and social benefits while the American people have been abandoned. I hope all those who have not decided to vote will look at where the radical democrats are taking this country."
1017,-1,"Actually Kamala Harris does have a plan. It’s just not a white peopleplan. White people you are not the only race of people in this country. Technically you should be the minorities because of how your forefathers took advantage of the Native Americans. And then took there land and there property, productive rights and there children away. Because you didn’t want Native American children to be who they were born to be. (Fact check it). So how darn you think that you know what you are talking about."
1018,3,That woman with the hat is really stupid.
1019,5,There are no undecided voters
1020,28,"It's best to avoid watching ABC, CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post, and USA Today, which are all left-wing news outlets."
1021,-1,Most of these are dumb white Americans
1022,-1,Trump you go back to prosperity. Remember???
1023,-1,Read trumps website. He’s got polices layed out in words.
1024,5,undecided = I just want attention and to feel important
1025,0,I’m sorry but any person who has through 3.5 yrs of Biden & Harris and is reportedly undecided needs very serious mental help. I can’t fathom such a problem. Makes you wonder how long such a person would need to remove their hands from a fire??
1026,5,"undecided want money from the pol. Parties 🤣 in our homeland - India, people who can't decide but accompany their friends, vote for ""NOTA"" last down button (not allotted) it beep peeeet! Done! ... that will serve the undecided folks at the last voting seconds."
1027,4,Great value Johnny Bravo
1028,-1,"Why would you show someone someone else’s answers with all that paper….? This report and the reporter are ignorant to say the least 😂, and then he only asked 2 ppl. Bye girl"
1029,1,"I don't think the moderators were fair.. Kamala never answered the economy question, yet they didn't ask her to answer it again... They did that to Trump several times . They also didn't fact-check her on lies, or push her on abortion in the 9th month..upto the moment of birth. Which is allowed is Tim Walz state. Look it up. Trump is for IVF.. she claimed he wasn't. It was a 3 on 1 debate. I'd like to see another.. without her Nova earrings."
1030,3,She never answered anything
1031,16,"US democrats manage to paint the brush it is male versus female on topic of abortion, disgusting, it is not right if it is for convenience. The communists control how many babies you have, never trust Kamala she is a two face snake flip flop every day"
1032,3,it wasnt fair she cheated people
1033,5,Please stop wasting your precious time and resources on chasing so called undecided voters. They are just attention seeks who need therapy.
1034,0,It is amazing how stubbornly resilient some of these Trump leaning Republicans are. He completely mismanaged Covid and tried to overturn an election and they still retain these romantic views of the Trump economy. Harris needs to break through to these people otherwise she could be in trouble.
1035,21,You the media are so corrupt yes ABC NBC CBS ALL SO CORRUPT

1041,5,"I don't understand ""undecided voters"". If policy is of no use, nor morality these people vote ONLY on one factor alone. Feelings. Base desires and primal urges. These people are Trilabites."
1042,5,yeah undecided means they are harris voters cause they are scared to say who they are voting for. 🤣
1043,4,Shanahan Light
1044,16,Few things sh*t me more than the deranged pro-abortion talking point that males are not allowed to have an opinion.

1056,29,Most will drink the Kool aid for the Orange 🍊 God King! People don't seem to exhibit critical thinking skills Keep in mind this is similar to how to how a certain Dictator in Germany came to power! Vote Blue 💙🔵 Through and through!
1057,20,Nonsense
1058,0,Nobody voted for Harris to be there
1059,-1,WTH is wrong with these people.. how much info do you need
1060,16,Trump brought abortion back to the States to decide. He doesnt have a say in it anymore
1061,4,Brando Springs
1062,-1,Head to head on issues... I don't think so. They didn't talk about many issues
1063,16,Why is undecided voter number two so concerned about abortion? She's never going to need one.
1064,-1,"Those fucking whitetrashes ""Mr. Trump2024 haters... such as & included the stupidest person in the world Taylor Swift lol"" rather supporting the one (Kamala Harris... She & the puppet Biden fucked Americans totheir teeth for the last four years!!!) who pushed their country to the shithole than supporting the one who is an honest man & care for America (MAGA MAN AND THE CHOSEN ONE ""MR. TRUMP2024""). No wonder why their parents before them took the USA to the shithole and lost the Vietnam war lol. Also, because those fucking whitetrashes so fucking STUPID, that's why the Chinese have out performed them in everything lol"
1065,16,"""I really believe that men should stay out of women's bodies."" 😮-say what now??"
1066,1,Huh. Thats ....fair from the first woman. Yeah.....yeah. I can see why Kamala wants another debate so soon. Its going or be a 50/50 toss up. She has a lot of big donors that dont wanna hear that and are spending a lot for a 50/50.
1067,5,Maybe we're better off with not so bright people skipping the vote~
1068,4,Clark Shirley Taylor Edward Martin Maria
1069,16,"No one is undecided at this point. If you lean a certain direction nothing is going to change that. I mean if you are for open borders and want abortion until the birth of the child. Then you likely vote Kamala. If you want controlled borders and reduced illegal immigration, end wars and want the people in each state to decide on abortion, you vote Trump.I mean they are quite polar opposite candidates and policies. If you want WW3, extreme inflation, socialism, abortion and triple the amount of illegals coming in. Vote Kamala."
1070,-1,interviewing 2 stupid undecided people
1071,-1,HTH do you guys function on a daily bases with brain like that? The world is laughing at you.
1072,7,I hate when people don’t listen he stood strong on foreign policy on economy Biden Obamah fundedIran which funded hamas how can she say he can’t stop war there shouldn’t be 2 wars 13 marines shouldn’t have died listen people pay attention abortion should not be birth control that’s bs take birth control be responsible
1073,-1,Trump is out there every day telling his plan those monitors didn’t give him a chance she lied about everything he does not he doesn’t have to his record is great
1074,-1,"President Trump won the debate despite the negativity and everyone heard Kamala's lies, people know. Kamala Harris stated on national televised debate that ""we're not going back"" to lower priced groceries and gasoline.Foreclosures, bankruptcies, all-time high credit card debt, border safety issues, homelessness, inflation, war and worse is what voters will get more of with Kamala Harris.Friend & I recently drove by some our city's homeless who were baiting birds with small pieces of bread, throwing rocks at the birds & cooking them to eat. President Trump was courageous for addressing the cats/dog report. Homelessness has doubled under Harris. People gotta eat and poverty is not some joke."
1075,14,He had great economy
1076,-1,Trump had great border when he was in
1077,31,The entire country will be like Springfield Ohio under Harris. She will let tens of millions more illegals in. That's a minimum.
1078,-1,Trump Vance 2024
1079,5,"If you are Undecided at this point, leave the vote for President box blank on your ballot."
1080,-1,they are just scared to go on record thats all
1081,-1,"How can someone with normal sense Vote for Kamala with zero leadership policy only lie, propaganda and sentiment. With kamala America will collapse economically, national and international. Kamala has zero leadership upstairs her head. America wake up save your country and yourself Vote Trump 2024"
1082,10,Only one has a plan. Hopefully that will reach voters like these. The debate is more a show of character which one was clearly the winner.
1083,-1,"WTH is even thinking about voting for a rapist, fraud, felon, top secret documents thief and traitor who ran the deficit up 8 trillion dollars, to say the very least. Any woman, veteran or minority who would vote for Trump, (the stupidest President who can’t even complete a sentence, wears diapers is in cognitive decline and plans to dismantle our government), is out of their minds or totally ignorant on what’s really going on. Go read Project 2025."
1084,0,I WAS BETTER OFF WITH TRUMP HIS RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF LIKE HIM OR HATE HIM HE DOES WHAT HE SAYS HARRIS DIDN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS TRUMP ROCK IT TRUMP 2024 CALIFORNIA BABY 😂😂
1085,10,The Country wants another Debate!!!
1086,7,I’m still convinced the American voter are complete morons and have adhd when it comes to issues at hand. They need to stop eating junk food and allow their bodies to detoxify before they make irrational choices for the future. A letter grade of a “C” to someone responsible for the border that hasn’t done anything to prevent this country from being invaded is irrational and dangerous.
1087,0,"Oh lawd. Anyone who doesn’t know at this point, they need help. And anyone who votes Harris needs help. Because we’re in TROUBLE here, and the ONLY one to get us out of it is TRUMP. He did it before and he can do it again, and he WILL do it again. And just because he didn’t share his plan on stopping wars, doesn’t mean he doesn’t have one. If he shared that with the people, it would be all over the world. That would just be STUPID. He’s not a stupid man."
1088,16,I love the statement that men should stay out of a womans body. LOL If that were to happen then you wouldn't be needing to get an abortion. How about women and men get back to not having sex and that way women wouldn't need to make a judgement that she might regret later in life. GOD gave us the ability to create and set one of the commandments Thou shalt not murder. So today IMHO it seems women are choosing to break that commandment rather then to create. I guess having sex is something people don't really think about what the end results of a short bit of pleasure can or might turn into. IMHO
1089,9,Trump❤❤❤❤❤❤
1090,16,Men should not stay out of women’s bodies.
1091,5,She is not undecided
1092,-1,"Assult wepons dont exist. It is a thing. Kane killed Able with an Assult rock. Assult is an addictive, not a noun."
1093,-1,They must’ve searched far and wide for the two DUMBEST people in Michigan. 🤦🏻‍♂️
1094,16,Men out of womens body? But men are in the body to make the baby..
1095,5,"Very skeptical of anyone who says they are undecided at this point. For the less than 1% who might actually be undecided, legal and constitutional scholars say that it's better to not vote. Just vote down ballot if you are familiar with the candidates and issues. Skip any that you aren't sure about."
1096,1,"I was disappointed neither was more specific in many answers, and dodged some entirely, but I wonder how much the time limits they had played into that? 1 minute isn't enough time to explain the whole, ""defund the police,"" thing, e.g. SO MUCH goes into that....I dunno. I also think Kamala has been a candidate for like a month, while Trump has had 3.5 years to carve out specific positions, so I take that into account as well........"
1097,20,"That's it, non-sense!"
1098,-1,I don’t blame Trump one bit for not wanting to give away the details of how he would put an end to the wars. The last thing you would want to do in that situation is to give your enemy a heads up on your plans for war or to end war or anything related to it. I would hope everyone from either side would understand this
1099,5,It’s quite clear that most undecided voters are utterly confused and misinformed.
1100,2,"They said that there’s no evidence that pets are being eaten but the people that actually live in Springfield have seen their lost pets hung in yards like deer, That sounds like pretty good evidence to me."
1101,3,"If her lips are moving, she is lying."
1102,7,Is it just me or is anybody else tired of these illegal filthy violent immigrants ruining my country? Please there has to be someone out there
1103,12,عاشق کالاهاما شدم ❤

1105,0,Trump ran into Harris traps! You thank that wasn't intentional? Thanks!
1106,1,What is Kamala plan? Does anyone know 🤔. Because she doesn't.
1107,-1,If you vote for Kamala (a current sitting vice president) expecting to see all these changes she’s talking about. You’re a special kind of stupid.
1108,2,"There are many YouTubers going to Ohio and interviewing people about these cats & dogs being eaten, I just watched a news video of a woman covered in blood after killing and eating a cat being arrested"
1109,1,"Kamala dangerous for America ,only Trump nationalist america"
1110,2,Why my dog and cat go kissing then huh?
1111,9,P
1112,-1,"why did the so called press keep ""fact check"" Trump but not kamela? You guys are a bunch of one sided idiots who will help elect a person who is not qualitied like you did when biden was elected. No wonder the press is hated !"
1113,1,"President Trump, we want you back, we are an Iranian, Minuseh Kamala Harris was nothing"

1124,3,Is she seeiously laughing? She's just a joke all around
1125,-1,Trump looked like a fool nd as usual avoided answering all the questions. He admitted he has no plan. Yet there are fools who watched this nd will still vote 4 him.
1126,5,"The fact that Trump is leading in the polls shows just how ignorant, racist, and sexist the majority of US citizens are. It’s eye opening"
1127,13,Trump 2025.
1128,-1,A drunk hooker for a candidate😂😂😂. Better than a dementia riddled pedo I guess.
1129,-1,"Trump walked into a 3 against 1 ambush, and lost his way trying to free himself from the clutches of the Dirty Dem controlled Army of evil:"
1130,7,Even Biden & Harris faild to run this country properly! Lot of illegal immigrant entered this country ! Open border like Cuba ! They don’t care about everything is so costly
1131,7,"Any one that thinks ""building a wall"" stops illegals from coming are idiots. Wasted billions already . Do some research on how much money 💰 was wasted on this useless project. Not to mention, it's useless and needs maintenance. Just enforce current immigration laws instead of all the Republican owned factories hiring illegals."

1138,2,"Wheres the proof and facts about springfield eating pets? Also we need abortions because we cant even take care of the kids we have now, like orphans. You wouldnt want to bring a kid in the world if no one could take care of it. If it was actaully banned in all states, imagine how many babies were be secretly murdered when theyre born. Abortion is safer and used before the baby is even fully developed. Dont force people to be parents when they know they cant be parents."
1139,9,Hello 🎉🎉 Myomyomon Yangon
1140,10,That was as one side has debates go.
1141,21,Don't you mean ABC attempts another Trump assassination?
1142,1,"Kamala Harris is not black, she is a Hindu portraying herself as a black woman to deceive the people.. if she'll lie about her nationality she'll lie about everything else... Biden and Kamala Harris have destroyed America. Why would you allow these people to continue to destroy America unless you want to be enslaved.."
1143,-1,I love her! I can’t imagine why any smart person would vote for trump! He is paranoid and seems to be in the throws of dementia!
1144,-1,Wow ...the comment section is unhinged 😳 Scary
1145,2,What the cat n dog has to do with it. That could be good there 1000s of dogs sacrifice for not been adopted. Other countries eat them

1154,-1,Trump is almost as demented as Biden was when they were competing. Yet all of his supporters will blindly follow him no matter what he says or does
1155,19,This video is so bad you can’t even get 10% likes on this video. I wonder what your dislikes are because it’s so bad.
1156,0,Harris absolutely 👍 💯
1157,-1,"Kamala said Jan 6 was a bigger threat to democracy than 9/11. Then her and joe left the 9/11 ceremonies early, couldn’t even stay to hear the families speak.

1163,-1,I don't know one single person is going to vote for that woman. She is horrible she is appalling. And that is also true what Trump said about the immigrants in Ohio. It's a disgrace
1164,30,All politicians lie. All news channels show bias in some way.
1165,0,"3 on 1, and Harris still said nothing"
1166,2,Eating dogs and cats............That's Koreatown.
1167,5,Brain rought in the comments just showing how successful government is on dividing people and making them believe either of these political parties are actually for the people.
1168,22,She wins America's done
1169,-1,I absolutely CANNOT STAND her facial expressions
1170,1,"There is more regarding Kamala than she is willing to disclose… and if many of those who support her understood what she is really about… you would be sick to your stomach!A New World Order agenda that will destroy our country… with a new governing system, which will cause more homelessness and allow immigrants to take advantage over our lives and country- it will allow criminals to do what ever they want without consequences… and you will have no right to complain… or you will be arrested and jailed!"
1171,-1,"Donald Trump faced the laughing hyena who is the Democratic Party or should we say the Democratic communist party has put forward for their candidacy for the presidency of the United States of America? If this isn’t a pathetic joke they just put Saturday Night Live to shame. The big propaganda machine is trying to portray this person who is masquerading as a vice president of the most powerful nation in the world is this what we’ve come to with the intellectual greatness of this nation we’ve got Minnie mouse as vice president of the most corrupt Democratic Party that’s ever existed in this nation and I’m not making fun of her because she knows herself her qualifications And why do you think she laughs in the face of all of her supporters? I think she’s beginning to realize the power of the big propaganda machine of the people who are addicted to the mindset of this machine if it wasn’t for her pixie dust that Disneyland associates make available to her, instead of laughing, she would be crying if it’s stupidity of the average American voter anyone who would stand with this so-called Democratic Party has deep emotional and mental issues and the rest of the world sees it is this the example that this republic is setting for the world and the big propaganda machine Called it a debate for all the realism. They could’ve held it in the outhouse Porta John, or whatever you might wanna call it Minnie mouse laugh, set her supporters while the rest of the world laughs at all of us like I’ve said before the average American is so addicted to the big propaganda machine that it’s actually mind-boggling the Democratic party has come to this is this Minnie mouse woman and her pixie dust the best candidate that they can put forward for the office of the presidency of the United States of America is a joke in itself. I’ve said it many times. God save this nation."
1172,-1,People..Harris and the dems are concentrating more on climate change then fixing this broke economy. Dont vote with your feelings this time and vote like your life savings depends on it. Im living in my car now cause i wanna save towards retiring. I wasnt do that 5 years ago..just sayin...Look at her up there laughing even if she thinks what trump is sayin is crazy. Shows where her head is at

1184,0,"Both candidates have served in the White House. Voters should consider whether their lives have improved over the past 3.5 years under the Biden/Harris administration or whether they were better off during Trump’s administration.If this assessment isn’t sufficient for making an informed voting decision, consider engaging with both Democratic and Republican viewpoints. Remember, social media algorithms tend to reinforce our existing beliefs by only showing content we're likely to click on, creating an echo chamber. By exposing yourself to diverse perspectives, including international viewpoints, you gain a broader understanding of the issues which will empower you to make that informed voting decisions."

Do you really believe Trump acting like an idiot, and Biden all of a sudden having ""dementia"" are coincidences? Wise up people."
1187,-1,"The truth is, under Trump the US didn’t start any war and the economy didn’t stumble. Under Bidee, the US paying for the Israeli war and for the war in Ukraine with the tax payers hard earned money. Which could be spent to help those millions of homeless families. If Carmela follows Bidee ways, than the days of the US empire are counting to lunch, but not up, in fact like a fast moving train is hard to stop."

1193,7,"All trump had to say to Kamala, when she says ""Immigration, blah blah, you killed the bill."" Trump then asked, ""If you know what I'm saying is lies about imagration you surely talked to these folks. Have you even been to the border?""when talking about border and Why are people at the border who have lived there for 25 years saying they used to see drug runners on their properties once a year, but as of January 2021, they started seeing paramilitary-looking drug runners with huge bags coming through in groups on a weekly basis? As of February 2021, this trend has continued. sHe continued, ""I gave a plan for inflation."" Trump responded, ""Well, you're in office now. Why has it gotten worse? On average, the policies of previous presidents affect, at most, the first 150 days to a year of another president’s term. So why is it getting worse? You said you had a great plan last time. Is this your great plan?""Regarding Roe v. Wade, Trump asked, ""Why haven’t you fixed it now? You're in office now. Fix it, like all that student loan debt that you messed up, yoh giys screwed around with the debt ruduction part its causing delays and negatively impacting the grades of many students with fafsa.

1222,21,"This was the most BIASED political debate in the history of the United States. ABC should be ashamed. ABC has lost all integrity.

1230,1,Kamala is Fake and disaster. She talked about Abortion and rights of Rape Victims girls for abortion but she did not spoke about the Security of young American Girls and Women who are easy targets of the Illegal Migrants whose background checks are not done... if there are less Illegal Migrants there will be less rape... We Want Our Country FREE From All Aliens 👽 Our Country is no more our country with Millions of Illegal Aliens

1257,-1,"She lost the debate, she didn’t say anything about her policies she was just shouting , talking nonsense , she didn’t answer any questions and they ask her baby questions they were not holding her accountable about her lies, but still Trump as a leader was able to defeat 3 against one . Everything was bias . she knew the questions in advance she is not a smart person , I have seen her talking in conference or the press and she has no knowledge at all. she just talks about herself. So boring I don’t care about her life I care about my country. She has been destroying the country but ignorant people just vote by their emotions they don’t check the policies,"

1270,1,Biggest scripted bs I've ever seen. The communist Kamala using earpieces.
1271,2,I found it it's on YouTube about the Haitians eating cats
1272,1,"Donald roasted her and the people rightfully roasted the ABC moderators for their incredible bias. They try to protect her but Kamala's severe lack of intelligence shines through quickly when she speaks. It would be devastating to women if the first one to get elected has the mentality of a child, the brains of a jellyfish and looks like something that I use my bidet every morning to forget about."
1273,-1,There was a man at the 9/11 memorial screaming to Trump “Where the hell have you been for the last 24 years? I’ve been here but you haven’t A-hole!”
1274,1,"Adios Kamala And Obama ,..!!"
1275,0,Harris cornered Trump and took revenge on Biden. She showed a strong personality while Trump talked about how world leaders feared him and that he ate cats and dogs and other nonsense. I believe that AIPAC and the Israeli lobby are the ones who decide who the new president of America is
1276,-1,"Too many people have been convinced there are threats to our country when there has always been when you are a free nation you can expect more than usual but it can be easily contained without removing free will freedoms the constitution expresses because it has always been contained that's why this is the safest country to live in with the best Financials best health, best prosperity, so why cry for a candidate like Trump that knows this already while he claims scare tactics!

1296,-1,More political corruption and dishonesty. Biden and team are proven treasonous criminals. This is a total disgrace!
1297,1,"If Kamala can make Trump dance on command, you know foreign adversaries have him figured out too. We can't have some that mentally weak running this country."
1298,0,Harris locked away innocent black men’s and refuse to grant them dna test kits to prove their innocence. My vote goes to Donald Trump who literally pardoned black rappers.
1299,-1,"Of course Trump left with a high amount of unemployment, we were just beginning to get underway for a years long pandemic. Biden didn’t create jobs, they were jobs that were refilling after the pandemic. They both were insufferable to listen to. Each diverting and never actually answering a question."

1303,0,Harris! Go go go
1304,-1,"This is a load of BS! This was a three on one confrontation. Harris told lie after lie but wasn't fact checked once.She claimed crime was down when it is actually up 47%. Silence from the 'moderators'. Harris claimed there are no US military personnel in combat situations. Actually US military units in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon have been subject to numerous missile and drone attacks. In addition US ships in the Mediterranean Sea have been attacked numerous times. Silence from the 'moderators.Harris repeatedly tried to link Trump to project 2025, even though he repeatedly said he has nothing to do with it. Another Harris lie. Again, silence from the moderators.Harris claimed that Trump called white supremists and neo-Nazis, fine people in Charlottesville. Yet another Harris lie. When Trump said there are fine people on both sides, he added, ""I'm NOT talking about the white supremists or neo-Nazis because they should be totally condemned."" No 'fact check from the 'moderators'.Harris claimed she never was against fracking, when there are at least three tapes on youtube that show Harris saying she will eliminate fracking. Where were the fact checkers?She claimed she never promoted ending private health care insurance, when there are tapes on youtube showing her doing that very thing. Where are you 'fact checkers'?That's just a small sample of Harris's numerous lies.The moderators not only didn't call out Harris for her lies, they even promoted lies of their own. They claimed no state allows a baby to die after it is born. Actually there are at least eight states that deny medical care and nourishment to a baby born after a botched abortion. This includes Harris's running mate, Walz, state of Minnesota.The ABC moderators were so obviously 'in the tank' for Harris, even CNN called them out for it.Actually, 74% of those surveyed believe Trump won the debate while only 24% believe Harris won. If Harris had won she wouldn't be begging for a second debate."
1305,6,"Nobody won, the election hasn't taken place yet."
1306,-1,Breaking news..The Goldman Sachs CEO just humiliated Kamala Harris on live TV and deflated another one of her lies at the debate.
1307,2,For your information it's not that they are eating people's fur babies get your facts together you're just like ABC or worse
1308,-1,"Trump won...his more truthful and sincere. Kamala did not have correct answers, just polish rehearsed propaganda slogan answers."
1309,16,"Since the mods didnt do it I fact-checked both:Harris stated she wasn't trying to take our firearms Fact-check 1: Kamala Harris expressed support for a mandatory gun buyback program in 2019 Trump believes in better control of who is purchasing. Harris stated there was no agenda for late term abortion Fact-check 2: Multiple states have no restrictions on it, a woman can find out late that her child has mental or physical defects and terminate the day of in some states i.e. the Virginia governor in 2019 proposed and advocated for late term and in his own words ""have a discussion with the mother on what to do with the 'child' after it is born"" verbatim. Tim Walz also removed reporting requirements for children who were ""botched abortions"" and left to die. Trump believes in the exceptions such as gr*pe but in early term. Harris stated Trump praised white-supremacist calling them fine people Fact-check 3: the rest of that sentence from Trump (you can look it up) was as follows ""I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally."" Trump was speaking on the people protesting the removal of national monuments who were both for and against it. Harris stated Trump organized J6 Fact-check 4: He didn't organize it, he wasn't even there. He was asked to make a statement and he urged them to be lawful and respectful as it is their right to protest (you can still find these tweets) and no one was armed. It went sideways when the ges ta po began beating the protestors which there is video evidence of. Police did die later and of completely unrelated reasons. Kamala however was there and there's recording of Pelosi saying nah to national guard when it got out of hand. Weird... Also note: She said J6 was the worst moment in American history since the CW the eve of the anniversary of 9/11. Extra weird... Harris blamed Trump for the border issues Fact-check 5: Brandon appointed her in control of the border because of the ""surge of people they needed to move"" knowing their was an influx of ""visitors"". There is also video of this. Trump didnt turn down the border law, Republicans refused it because it came with ""deviled details"" that instructed anyone who DOES cross cannot be detained so in essence they were trying to be sneaky and the Center of Immigration reported Bidens deal would do nothing if not make it worse. Trump tried to build a wall, Harris stated it wouldn't do anything to help, now she wants to build the wall all of a sudden. Strange. Bonus: Harris stated all the corrupt politicians that worked for Trump whom he fired now support her. This is true. And Walz family, Harris own father, and a good chunk of the Democrat and Independent party now support Trump creating the Unity Party."
1310,-1,“I have concepts of a plan” should be trumps campaign slogan
1311,0,It came off as though ABC and the brains behind Harris had a plan and what buttons to push. She just said what she was told

1351,6,"If the question is who won, perhaps your best bet is run spot run?"
1352,15,America are screwed if Trump doesn't get in again.
1353,21,ABC LOST FOR SURE!
1354,-1,That was 3 against 1. He didn't lose ground in the polls. Get real. Kamala didn't offer any solution.
1355,6,Wow even Murdock isn't claiming he won
1356,23,1:04 THIS IS THE TRUTH
1357,21,Main stream media are useless
1358,-1,"Harris is best friends with the ABC boss, this is why the moderator constantly interrupted him and let kamala do whatever she wanted.. Also the reason why she refused to do a debate with fox news."
1359,17,"Trump, hands down"
1360,-1,What a useless report. Why bother even putting this together? Failed to inform your viewers about barely anything to do with the actual debate and the immediate fallout. It’s almost like you hadn’t even seen it. Won’t bother with this publication again.
1361,17,Trump
1362,6,trump won. its time to make our nation great again
1363,14,President Trump is good and kimili is always a Liar always a Liar again
1364,1,"Kamala Harris is not talented enough to shoulder the responsibility of a powerful country like the United States. Four years with her administration, America is very weak. If her administration lasts for another four years, America will collapse. She cannot become the president, the person who has enough ability and intelligence to lead America, that is President Trump.. Support TRUMP + VANCE"
1365,-1,Donald won… Kamala just bla bla bla … not answering the questions asked… lot of body language with Kamala Harris. No core in words. Just empty….

1369,17,Trump
1370,6,Pretty obvious trump won it
1371,1,"Kamala had the questions prior, used notes, an earpiece, and lied about every accusation of Trump while avoiding any answers on policy!!!! Trump 2024"
1372,1,Who gives a frack...all major decisions are made in Tel Aviv anyhow
1373,-1,"The Australian is now as woke as the ABC , both the pathetic Australian version and the American variant.I once read the Australian newspaper for 15 years before it started leaning left . Thank god I stopped reading it 12 years ago, as a result, I managed to stop the brain rot that would have ensued if I had kept on reading this trash!"
1374,1,"CHECK THE CONFESSION BY ABC David Muir - Freudian REVEAL. He admitted that President Trump was elected in 2020, when :- MUIR said to VP Kamala that she and President Trump were elected 4 years ago.!"
1375,2,They actually are eating the pets there’s pictures of them taking geese out of the park. These Haitians performing voodoo in Ohio.
1376,24,President Trump wins of coarse shes a gun owner and needs him to protect the 2nd Amendment.
1377,6,USA citizens better hope that trump wins because if he doesn't a type of civil war and social discord will ensue.
1378,17,Trump!
1379,11,Donald Joke😂😂😂😂😂
1380,-1,Fake news
1381,-1,When a debate is rigged from the start there's no winners only losers. Kamala lied at least four times they didn't fact checked her at all. How on earth was this debate can even be valid when the media sets its interests before the voters. CNN wanted Biden Out of that race that's why they fact checked every single one of his questions. This time Kamala had not been put against the wall and was allowed to lie freely. Sorry but I can't stand media these days. The Australian is just another pile of garbage also.
1382,2,"Wait until they see the footage of the aliens eating animals, and the shiela with 3 big city rats cooking on a spit fire in NY city..on the street..its looking very 3rd world now."

1387,2,They are eating the pets . The Dems have voted for infanticide
1388,1,Hey she had an ear piece in Shes a liar no fact checking her lies but they fact checked him 5 times Its the most biased set up debate pro Kamala pro demoncrat 3 against one She lied about everything
1389,10,Don't care - I am Republican and voting Republican. Debates are basically useless!
1390,-1,Trump won by a mile in the debate AND at running the US. But I much prefer listening to Kamala when she has an earpiece in and someone telling her what to say.
1391,17,Trump
1392,-1,Bro ABC moderators are a disgrace for completely taking her side
1393,11,❤️🇺🇸. TRUMP .🙏💙
1394,2,Theyre eating the pets 😂 America..Vote TRUMP FOR JAIL 2024
1395,6,Three against one. Not really the American way.
1396,6,"I don't even like Trump and we all know he won by a landslide lmao, our media in Australia is the biggest joke in an already joke of an industry."
1397,6,No. One. Will. Win.
1398,2,"We saw the newspaper reports of immigrants eating a cat and a swan,vwe have the internet"
1399,8,Trump will be the one that ends the world as we know it! if re elected god help us all!
1400,1,"Fake kamala, Liar kamalaThis fake lady Fools stupids with her words & acting"
1401,1,"I can see why Kamala campaign wants another debate so soon. The general feeling is that the debate was a tie and didn't move the needle much. And I see more and more videos on this come out, the sentiment of 'eh' appears more and more true. Both sides are going to have to step up their game to beat the 50/50 toss up."
1402,-1,LIBERAL MEDIA TRYING TO SWAY WEAK MINDED VOTERS TRUMP CALIFORNIA 2024 BABY LIKE HIM OR HATE HIM HE DOES WHAT HE SAYS
1403,29,"OHIO, WAKE UP!!! IT’S TIME TO VOTE BLUE!🔵 🔵 🔵 🔵"
1404,29,The Republican-led state of Ohio has the second-highest drug overdose death rate in the United States. Ohio ranks number 10 in the top 10 states with the lowest life expectancy. The U.S. state with the highest drug overdose death rate? The Republican-led state of West Virginia.
1405,-1,Trump won...and all she could do was LIE
1406,3,What about her body language when she was asked the very first question are you better off now than you were 4 years ago they never talked or asked about that bias
1407,-1,"She is a liberal. Of course she thinks she was winner. Really, even though there was 3 on one?"
1408,0,"Harris expressions were all bad acting ..It wasn't what she actually felt . Remember ,this is a national debate with politicians. Harris didn't show any confusion ,panic , nervousness , or stumbling like she usually does because she new all the softball questions before hand .She also knew she wasn't going to be fact check or challenged.. That makes all the difference in the body language . Her body language was scripted with a bunch of B.S.answers just like this this lady and video. This body language expert .smile at the end is showing that she is thinking about all the money she making for praising Harris ,whom she is going to vote for..while knocking Trump What do you expect from FAKE NEWS.... ."
1409,-1,Not one sided at all...😂
1410,3,She had all the answers and questions beforehand. Fact check 0 times . ABC should be ashamed of themselves.. I wouldn't vote for her if you gave me a million dollars.. she's a dangerous candidate because she's a puppet
1411,-1,The lady in the dress is Thick.
1412,-1,Really........this is so dumb.......you can bring another one that would do the same thing with trump and find out he was lying also.......so what's your point here ....beside political gain from one candidate???......would be nice to have someone impartial doing interview or comment's about both of them......
1413,-1,Isn't it amazing how more than one person can watch this segment and come up with so many different conclusions? Trump isn't very bright. Please don't confuse wealth with a high IQ. I personally know a lot of wealthly people that aren't very bright. Trump is pretty much an idiot that only cares about himself and lies about virtually everything. I will never be able to make sense of what the average middle-class American who is in the MAGA cult sees in this man. Trump is nothing but a want-to-be bully with the vocabulary of a 5th grader.
1414,0,"He does not respect her at all. He is not giving an inch. Trump is hiding his body language to seem in control. Harris is just letting her emotions go, which is smart. The stoacism school is wrong and dangerous. They see no value in being human. It’s a movement that body language experts are blind to. It’s a deliberate attempt to hide body language, by dark tetrad personalities that experts are naive to, and feel uncomfortable calling out. Cowards"
1415,-1,This is just method acting in reverse 😕
1416,2,What a complete joke of a breakdown...they ARE EATING PEOPLE'S PETS!!! MSM SUCKS!
1417,0,Harris didn’t debate she attacked Trump the whole time!
1418,1,As a self proclaimed analyst of sorts I say Kamala looks like a bully and doesn’t really care about what we care about.
1419,25,He seems to know more inside
1420,25,It’s called underconfident because well he’s new here but he’s doing his best and he did better than we hoped
1421,20,Confidence is a sign of lie sometimes
1422,-1,Ummmm am I the only one who saw her initiate the handshake!?!? 🥴
1423,-1,People aren't stupid. Donnie put out a lynching call in Springfield and the threats began. What's next? A lie about raping white women?
1424,0,"Not only did Harris clearly win the debate, she also showed to be a better president.Vote blue!"
1425,14,A lot of Trump cult members on here who support an unprincipled morally bankrupt man
1426,-1,Trump2024
1427,10,the debate then democrats should admit that they have caused a tremendous disaster in this country for the past 3 AND a half years AND no one knows who has been running the country since joke biden has forgot even His own name😂.
1428,3,You just make people more hate her.
1429,1,Exaggerating Acting kamala
1430,-1,"So we know who this ""body language"" expert supports! I could read them better than she does"

1432,-1,This lady is another leftist schill
1433,-1,body language does not lie
1434,-1,"That's not him being unsure, that's him being appalled at what they're allowing people to get away with. That his ""this is so unbelievable"" pause and expression."
1435,0,"Body language expert. Lol This was a waste of time.. you know what side she is pushing, non parcial at all. I am no expert but i can see that right off the bat. Harris is a flat out narcissist. Everything about her behavior she was trying to push buttons to get a reaction from trump, him defending himself and then using that reaction against him. That is exactly what was happening."
1436,19,"Unbelievably terrible editing. Half of the video the expert says ""he (or she) does like this"" referring to something she's showing and we instead see the candidates."
1437,1,"Aww, look at the butthurt Misogynists can't handle the fact that their ""Messiah"" was mauled."
1438,0,"Vice President Harris won that debate no matter what... hand open, eyes closed, smiling and etc."
1439,-1,This woman's insight was a lot better than the video of a guy I saw trying to interpret their body language.
1440,0,"harris was a clown, no real answers"

1442,-1,"WFAA : T00 much c£ns0r!ng ! Extr££m F£ar 0 the TRUTH ?!? That “ expert “ is a MUD RUCKER, tossing mud onto a wall !"

1451,-1,She looks like she was wearing No a H1 Audio pearl earrings!!! Look them up!! Cheater always a cheater
1452,0,Biased against Trump ..... Harris will Decimate USA as Starmer is Decimating ours. UK
1453,-1,"Bruh ... I'm not even a body language expert and when they asked Kamala on the withdrawal its clear that she was deflecting, searching for a good response even when the outcome is bad. I mean watch the beginning of her response and after she deflected to saving money ... the moment she got into the supposed good part, for saving money, her speech picked up and she sounded clearer compared to before when she was searching for good excuse and her speech slowed down and she was looking up and to the right (just google what looking up and to the right is ... let me save you some time ""looking to the right and up indicates that a person is telling untruths"". Like c'mon this is BS to the max and the reporters should have picked up on the clearly biased take of the corrupted body language ""expert""."
1454,0,Trump beat Harris 33-0 in number of lies told. Trump told some whoppers. My entire family has 8 votes ready for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in North Carolina. 🔵🌊
1455,16,Notable how Trump’s sweatstache suddenly appeared while ranting on about neonatal terminations.
1456,-1,"I love Trump's obvious tells when he agrees with his opponents but because he's elderly and he's usually surrounded by his sycophants he's forgotten how obvious a tell it is and he thinks if he only nods a little bit that no one will see him agreeing. Given that we know honesty is not his thing, this nodding tell is a clear indicator of senility. I mean, would you want a president who would loose at poker every time to meet foreign leaders?"
1457,21,"The ABC bias is amazing. This is their response to Dr Phill analysis. He had real experts with over a dozen published books, and who are military level experts on the matter. They dug up the DEI pick, who has no books published."
1458,0,"The handshake won the debate. He hunched over and never straightened up, defensively on the run the whole time."
1459,19,"this lady missed the fact ""the cackler"" did 0 the entire debate other than try to cover up doing 0 but lie and attempt to deceive using expressions especially in the eyes of ""trying to look innocent"" while doing so. that is, even in modeling, the pros know NOT TO LOOK DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA at least most of the time so the focus would be in a model's case where it should be ""on the clothes or item being sold"" NOT themselves ... but ""the cackler"" all night kept looking directly into the camera to keep the focus on her with her pretending to be innocent expressions NOT on the facts of the disasters plus she deliberately plotted in causing especially at our border, afghanistan, inflation, the illegal ch-eye-na connection, crime, causing multiple wars, etc."
1460,0,Scripted harris show includes body language
1461,0,what a biased body expert i watched several of them and she is the only one saying Harris won .
1462,2,I watched the video of a woman being arrested after eating a cat .
1463,31,"Just another democrat while ABC says don’t listen to the people in Springfield, listen to us tell you it’s not true while they send thousands of police and $3 million to Springfield 😂😂😂"
1464,20,Complete BS.
1465,1,Kamala did a fantastic job last night!!! 💙
1466,-1,The expert might need to retire
1467,9,😍😍😍
1468,4,Miller Betty Garcia Sandra Allen Jason
1469,19,Shocked he didn't stalk her the way he did with Hillary. He's a predator.
1470,23,2:21 The word is especially ARGH! There is NO FREAKIN' “X” IN THE WORD “ESPECIALLY!” Stop saying “Expecially!” Seriously .
1471,0,Harris was wearing Nova ear Bud earrings .She cheated
1472,26,TRUMP 2024 ❤🇺🇸
1473,-1,"🤡Kamala, Biden y Obama llevan 12 años destruyendo el país, estos son los verdaderos coyotes de la frontera, que desastre deberían estar presos. El desastre de la economía actual y las guerras se lo debemos también a Kamala no ha hecho nunca nada...🤬🤬"

1478,11,👍🏼 He got played like a Demented Fiddle! 😂
1479,-1,"This is not an expert, this is a fanatic😂😂"
1480,1,"Kamala blink rate through the roof. Indicating possible lying, or maybe struggling to hear both Trump and the earring speaker in her ear at the same time."
1481,19,"I like how Trump never looks at the person he’s debating, while they practically stare at him it’s such a power move😂👌 it shows who the dominant and confident personality is"
1482,-1,"Where did you find the America's most biased and stupid Body Language ""Expert"" ⁉️"
1483,1,Kamala's endorsement of Cheney and Bush did her in from that point on.
1484,21,ABC the corrupt media
1485,-1,fools eating this is truly happens... these fools buying abc fools words
1486,0,Harris is a bar hagg. She's a cartoon poser. She knows how to get what she wants from men.
1487,0,I knew from the first second I saw this lady that she would be for Harris.
1488,-1,Wow. Lots of trolls here today!
1489,-1,Thank you for fact checking !
1490,-1,Nice propaganda
1491,-1,"Small hand of his LOL,"
1492,1,Kamala came off smug and makes actions for she has no answers
1493,-1,The expert was wrong.
1494,-1,She ate Trump for dinner.
1495,3,Trump is a nut job. She just put that old traitor in his place.
1496,-1,"Curious that this supposed ""expert"" completely missed the significant nonverbal nervous actions Harris repeatedly displayed.Most obvious:• a large increase in the number of blinks when she repeated her rehearsed and memorized speech to when Trump spoke. Anxiety and stress trigger the nervous system, causing involuntary twitches, aka blinks.• her head movements and positions while Trump spoke about her, such as resting her head on her hand. People who are lying may change their head position, such as tilting it to the side, bowing it down, or jerking it back.• several times, she shook her head left-to-right while she spoke, indicating disbelief in her own words. People subconsciously shake their head ""no"" when they lie. As people lie, their brain knows the words are false, and they shake their head as in ""no."" When people are telling the truth, they tend to nod up and down as in ""yes""."
1497,0,Great job on VP Harris' body language. She uses being muted to her advantage to convey her reactions when she could not speak.
1498,-1,News media is liars im starting to see what trump is saying how bad the media is to him
1499,-1,She’s a Kamala voter. Trump planned the hand shake play not Kamala 🤣🤣🤣
1500,-1,Good body language analysis... most of them are goofy.

1507,-1,"""👏👏TRUMP USA HOMELAND & OVERSEAS 2024👍"""

1514,25,Hes scared he will loose again
1515,-1,"Trump already done 2 debates ....I don't think he needs to do it again....kamala wants to debate again because because she knows she did not win the first debate eventhough she received sample questions prior to the debate...Trump's message is loud and clear... The way things are shaking up right now, Trump will win this election..."
1516,28,CNN working to install a second marxist leader.

1519,-1,Trump already did a cnn debate
1520,10,"Why debate when you’re winning? Amer Ghalib, mayor of the Detroit-area suburb Hamtramck, the only Muslim majority city in the US, has endorsed Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, Even the Muslim community is turning on her, Kamala’s history.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
1521,10,"Trump says no debate. To mark the occasion Chinese restaurants all across the nation are changing the dish ""orange chicken"" to number 45 on all menus."
1522,-1,Trump refused because he is a coward.
1523,-1,Way cnn?Better if her husband and Joe Biden be moderaratos in sleepy joe basement and DOCTOR Jill will served coffee donuts and ice cream for joeIs more save for Kamala
1524,18,"She was offered 2nd debate on Fox but declined. She is in no position to declined offers. You want to be commander and chief, and then she needs to demonstrate leadership qualities by going into a hostile environment. Trump already debated on CNN and ABC, both networks lean more left, but he did want leaders do. She is no leader, no backbone, was a DEI picked"
1525,18,"Trump already did 2 debates on a liberal propaganda channel. He agreed to Fox, but Kamala said no. NOW go tell that!"
1526,-1,Trump should fake bone spurs and miss another debate.
1527,18,Debate OMG- she repeated slogan lines and laughable sayings . Trump does not need to debate and he would on a respectable network. Not CNN abc etc…
1528,-1,"Just stop going to these rigged debates. Its even come out that the last one was rigged, why would he do another unless its by someone impartial like Rogan"

1530,0,Harris is the female version of Trudeau.
1531,0,Why did Harris say no to Fox?
1532,-1,2nd Debate MUST BE on FOX News!
1533,-1,CNN wouldn’t fact check her either
1534,18,Every time global CTV or CBC post bias news clips report them as misinformation. It actually has consequences . Why would he want another debate when they gave her the questions in the last last one?
1535,30,How about a mediator that isn’t biased and has some credibility.
1536,-1,Trump just makes up his own narrative in his own reality & talks about that instead.
1537,20,😂😂😂 he is a mess… he is an actual mess! He just keeps lying.
1538,10,"lol... ""debate"" !"
1539,22,His entire campaign is predicting that she will lose the election.

1548,-1,Fox debate!
1549,-1,CNN is a joke. News media at it most bias. All they do is attack Trump. They want a fair debate? Do one on FOX with Hannity or Jesse Watters with muted microphones.
1550,18,"I hope Trump says debate with Fox or nothing...he's done 2 debates now with anti trump media..enough. of course Harris said yes, it's with CNN make her do one with Fox...she won't, she's a coward."
1551,13,"2nd debate, what a joke. Trump 2024"
1552,-1,This is practically a walk off for Trump.
1553,-1,That's why CNN was fair with Trump VS Biden. It was planned to not headbut Trump because the leftists wanted Joe out of the way.If Trump accepted the debate with Harris on CNN we know darn well it won't be fair this time around.Nice try.
1554,-1,That's right she wants a cnn push
1555,-1,It should be on his terms this time on Fox
1556,-1,"We now have an ABC whistleblower with proof, who has stated that the last “debate” was unfair and biased. No 💩 Sherlock! It’s as though they didn’t kill the “rat” in the first trap set out, now they want to set a second trap. Thing is…rat’s maybe pests and nuisances, but they’re very smart. Nice try though Kameltoe!"
1557,-1,She know nothing worldly historical economical a total O
1558,18,She declined the original schedule. Her campaign is a mess and needs this to have any chance.
1559,-1,This guy's afraid of another debate. If you are so smart and said you won the debate then show up and debate her. But you wont because you're losing to her and can't handle it. 😂😂😂😂
1560,-1,Nobody cares.
1561,-1,"Trump reminds me of Roberto Duran in the second Sugar Ray Leonard fight saying ""no mas"""
1562,-1,"To all people saying Fox asked to run the debate. Fox did indeed ask but Trump doesn't want the people asking the questions. He wanted his partisan loyalist to do it. It just goes to show how scared Trump is to debate Harris again, that he wants a rigged debate to let him take advantage. Even if the debate happened with Fox, he would lose again."
1563,10,The debate for both of them was pathetic.
1564,-1,""" Broadcast that second debate from Fox news channel"" 🙂👍"
1565,10,HE DOESN’T WANT TO DEBATE BECAUSE HES ALREADY WON THE PEOPLES VOTES!!!!!! TRUMP4CANADA

1567,-1,I don’t get what people see he is not president mater😢ial
1568,1,Sure Kamala accepts another rigged appearance with BFFs asking and answering for her while throwing garbage and lies at Trump. What crook wouldn’t.
1569,18,We didn’t get to see her debate in the primary. She’s sneaking in without even running.
1570,18,why won't she debate on FOX TRUMP 2024
1571,18,She turned down fox. Always on her terms or her handlers
1572,18,"The fact that she refused Fox shows she is looking for another sand bag,set up biased gang up job like the ABC fiasco. Trump is wise to avoid the CNN obvious trap as his momentum is great and she is faltering badly, especially after the Oprah clown show."

1578,-1,"Trump did ABC, why wouldn't Kamala do Fox?"
1579,1,If he debates her again then he's not as smart as i thought. Kamala has stolen Trump policy's and is now running with them. She had almost 4 years to fix a border she helped break.

1583,25,hes a coward.
1584,8,God bless trump
1585,2,All the cats and dogs applaud Trump. Also funny he talked about a fighter saying he wants a rematch when the lose. Seems like I heard this statement from him before.
1586,28,"I'm really surprised that global allowed. The comments to be put up too. Seems how they're crazy liberal nobody believes any of your crap anymore. Any of you guys, even the CBC radio mainstream media is so left. It's not even funny and the worst part is is 25 years ago. I would have been considered left. Now I'm considered extreme conservative I'm sure by the liberals /democrats 🙄🙄🙄"
1587,17,Whatever we stand trump
1588,-1,Looks to me like a lot of you are in for a big shock come November.

1593,-1,Chicken
1594,28,CNN is a garbage network…why is Global so cosy with them….ummmm
1595,0,"if you look at trumps playbook it is taken directly from Sun Tsu-“If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected .” The Second line sums up trumps reluctance to engage Harris again. He knows that she is superior in every way, smarter, more clever, better informed, etc. trump wants no part of that so he ""evades' her. he knows that he cannot beat her and his only, and tired, play is to lie. That is trump. trump attacks when his opponent is weak and runs when his opponent is superior. According to his Neice he has always been that way, a bully to weaker kids and running home crying when he is confronted by an equal or better force. In short trump is a classic bully and coward. He tells his minions that 'i got your back' but when asked about his involvement in the capital storming he says, I had nothing to do with that, I just made a speech. He is no hero to the people he runs when challenged instead of showing character. classic trump."
1596,-1,"Trump isn't a debater, has no plans, knows no factual information. This criminal needs jail time."
1597,18,"He offered to do THREE debates. CNN abc and Fox. She ran away and would only do abc, which is run by her good friend that introduced her and her husband. The moderators lied and were bias, she should do one on Fox to even it out. She won't because she can't. This woman didn't win a single primary, her presidential run is an insult to democracy."
1598,28,why not fox news?.... Trump did ABC.......
1599,-1,Fox News or no debate!!!
1600,-1,Why not do the debate on Fox News ?
1601,-1,"Time to retire, grandpa. Stop making a fool of yourself in front of your grandchildren."
1602,-1,It would be suiside to vote for her! People wake up! Anyone who thinks they need her telling them what to do is a threat .
1603,28,Fox News should get a debate or Newsmax. Not another far left tv station like Global
1604,18,"Because nobody will see her if there isn’t a debate, who is she ?"
1605,-1,Donald says its too late to have a debate. It is way past his jail time.😂😂😂

1610,26,Trump 🇺🇸👍 2024!!!❤
1611,-1,"AZ is compromised. A video on X showed illegals admitting that a rep showed up to sign them up to vote, filled out the ballots, all for Harris. The left are cheating already."
1612,-1,Nah Trump is leading 60 percent while Kamala losing 30 percent.
1613,28,Finally a news station that left personal opinions aside!!! I’m a woman and I’d rather have trump lead so if any men think otherwise I’d think again🤷🏻‍♀️

1617,0,"I predict 276 for Harris, 262 for Trump"
1618,-1,"Trump wins because under Harris over 8.5 million Illegals have been encountered at the southern border and 3 million got away. ""Source CBP.

Gas prices up 38% per AAA, Food up 21% source Axios, Mortgage rates up 148%, Source Bankrate Home insurance up 61% per NAIC, Car insurance up 118% per NACI, Real wages down 2.24% bureau of labor and statistics."

1623,-1,Fake. No way that many people are voting for 4 more years of horrible policies and border horror.
1624,7,Our Open Borders and our Military readiness should be at the top of the list for this election. What does YOUR candidate say about each? Think about it when you vote!! If we don't have a secure border and are we are not able to defend ourselves against other countries properly nothing else really matters!! Every area of our lives are being threatened. Trump/Vance 2024
1625,8,"If you believe the Poles, i have a bridge to sell you."
1626,13,Trump 2024
1627,-1,"Trump 2024! Vote for peace and to prevent WWIII. Now, more than ever, we MUST unite as a nation. There are forces that want to see this country crumble, forcing Americans into suffering and control. Kamala is a puppet in their game, serving the elite's agenda to destabilize this great nation. They want higher taxes, more immigration, fewer job opportunities, and the spread of crime and drugs, threatening the future of our children. The elite want the American Dream to disappear, and Kamala DOESN'T CARE for women’s rights or the values, she's only after EMPTY MINDS. If you truly care about your country and its future, vote for Trump. He may not be perfect, but he stands for a stronger economy and a better America."

1661,7,"People are actually voting for more of the same life ? More money to ukraine. Unlimited illegals, print more money. Whos setting the trade deals with president Xi? More money laundering into DC pockets. Wtf"
1662,16,"Tramp has already given his hand away… he said “If I lose there will be a BLOODBATH!” He’s absolutely counting on it, because it will validate his importance and existence in his own mind. If you really listen to the things he says, it’s blatantly obvious that he couldn’t care less about killing an unlimited number of innocent people who have already been born, but he has literally “roped in” the Christian nationalists on a “single issue” with his promise of a national abortion ban! I asked my closest friend how she could stand behind him and her response was that he’s the “only one” that will ban abortions! Well I’ve got news for you… he’s the only one that will take away your freedom and flush democracy down the toilet!"
1663,0,"Very funny, saw all over the woirld completely other polls, much more advantageous for Madam Vice President Harris. Are you keeping the maga-crowd calm before the storm??"

1668,-1,Pennsylvania supports Donald Trump Harris will never win Pennsylvania who stands with Pennsylvania?????
1669,-1,We need a candidate that will offer real food. As an American that's traveled and lived all over Skyrim america were all dying from fake food and nasty water. We need a more Nordic landscape with rivers we can drink from and reindeer to eat . Let them walk in the woods and parks . King salmon cam be breed in a pool meant for them . We can easily produce real food globally . Also the right color green green apples are the ones hag build muscle without working out . Those are real apples watered with real raw sun filtered river water . Not dead water from a hose or pipe. Im asking for the people to force both candidates to have a standered up to a level of real food like I just explained . We also need pot trees will make the water tropical and turn sand white everywhere.
1670,22,Trump will win in a landslide like never before seen and democrats party knows it! She has NO plans nottta nothing.
1671,-1,"If you are a young person considering voting for Harris, consider this and nothing will change. The border will remain open, the illegals will get the money you should be getting, Inflation won’t get better it will only get worse. Please consider these facts before you enter the voting booth … SINCE BIDEN AND HARRIS TOOK OFFICE: Groceries: +21.2% Eating out: +21% Baby food: +29.6% Pet food: +22.7% Rent: +20% Electricity: +28.4% Natural gas: +30% Apparel: +12% Used cars: +20.3% Air fare: +31.4% Public transportation: +20.8% Gasoline: +100% Car Insurance: +40% Real average weekly wages: -4.2% Personal credit card debt over a trillion. Interest rates at 7 percent. Unburden yourself from the past 3 1/2 years - Do not vote for more of the same, don’t vote for Harris or any Democrats.

1675,6,Donald Trump is not winning.Donald trump is losing just like he lost the debate and just like he lost twenty twenty and he's still telling the big lie
1676,0,"I have yet to meet someone who likes Harris. So every other person likes her, huh? Show me."
1677,0,Trump holds 27 states I think and Harris has about 26 or 24 Harris but I only say that because theres battle ground states and trump is leading the battle ground states but Harris has big states and Harris and trump has a tie in the polls but trump is doing little bit better then harris but remember harris has big states I voted for trump i hope you found this helpful love you all❤
1678,-1,"2%, that has to be wrong? I know there are a lot of total morons out there, who don't know what time of day it is but Trump who is for Americans (you know, the people voting) should be 40 points ahead of Harris (who is not for Americans)."
1679,6,Looks like trump is winning

1685,6,Trump win Ohio
1686,0,LOL. Marginally leading in 3 out of 7 'battleground' states. Lumping them all together as if they are one is pitiful spin-doctoring.
1687,0,Diddy and Obama left the group
1688,-1,"Im 28, got 6 months left to live due to severe cancer, and even though I won't be around for long once the new president moves into the white house, I hope to see my beautiful country in good hands again before I go. Vote Red Pls ❤❤❤❤"
1689,8,I pray for Trump team
1690,22,I cannot fathom the logic of how so many people voted for her. Do people not have a brain? I am so shocked.
1691,-1,"Blonde Orange continues to throw a fit like a big Baby Huey, he needs to learn to accept defeat and move on with his life. The clown needs to go back to hosting The Apprentice, because that's all he'll ever be good at. Kamala Harris, aka Harley Quinn is always laughing whenever she gives a speech on stage, she can't seem to keep a straight face and sounds like a hyena. For now, let's just kick back and relax, pop open a bag of popcorn and enjoy the comedy show that is Politics. Nobody really wants to see a Blonde Orange vs Harley Quinn Election battle in November, that's just a waste of time and energy. People should be more concerned about the 2028 Election Race, because that is where their votes are really going to make a difference. During the past two years, Drag Strips and Speedways across the country have been getting closed down. We should be out there fighting to keep racetracks alive and stop them from getting destroyed. spend money to help out the Stock Car Racing community. Our country needs a much younger 30-40-year-old president, one who knows what they are doing. A new president who will cut down the cost of housing, rent, food, health care, gas prices, cars/trucks, and our taxes by 100 percent."
1692,28,Fox................ lol..............awful...............paid 800 million dollar fake news fine........ha ha.
1693,8,May God please make TRUMP our president
1694,0,"For anyone supporting Harris, you really need to go look at her history. She is a death sentence to our country, to your children!!! What is wrong with you people??"
