      "I'm sick of debates where the debaters don't answer the questions they were supposed to.\n",
      "Trump 2024!\n",
      "Funny how his biggest fear is that his beloved guns get taken away...\n",
      "C'mon Donald ... Duck. She has a plan : let the FED print more money to \"save\" the economy. It will work , look at how GREAT Joe Biden did ! He is such a lovely guy look at how he is around little children , he just loves those 😡🤬!\n",
      "For anyone interested, timestamps of the debate that Josh Johnson talks about in his video \"They’re Eating WHAT? Another Debate Debacle\": 31:35 Kamala on people leaving his rallies early, followed by trump immediately responding to it, followed by... 33:16 \"...they're eating the DAWGS!\" + kamala laughing in his face 1:22:18 \"And THIS ... ... former president...\" (invited the taliban to camp David) 1:30:42 First question about medical plan 1:32:32 Second question about medical plan and subsequent \"I have concepts of a plan.\"\n",
      "Trump!\n",
      "I like how incredibly weak Trump's comment on climate change was, not talking about climate change or how to stop it in any way, instead dissing other countries and biden, like usual. A bit too much emphasis was put on 'improving manufacturing' in both responses, considering that that's one of the big reasons for climate change\n",

      "Now I listen to the people that lived in Springfield and they were talking about the people who had 15,000 food stamps when they go to the store those were people that was brought here and food vouchers to purchase housing they were talking about the Haitians that was placed here by the government so when you hear Trump saying they're eating the pets he's not talking the legal Haitians because he never talked about Haitians in the past eating animals so someone trying to put Trump saying is the Haitians but he never said that\n",
      "Ada indikasi zelensky menyelewengkan atau menikmati berbagai bantuan militer bersama-sama dengan biden untuk kepentingan pribadi mereka dengan mengorbankan rakyat dan tentara ukraina. Hal ini dapat dilihat dari banyaknya bantuan militer yang dikerahkan keukraina yang pada akhirnya tidak menghasilkan apapun. Mereka hanya bisa memperlambat tentara rusia, namun tidak pernah ada hasil yang memuaskan bagi ukraina. olehnya itu kita semua patut menduga bahwa bantuan tersebut hanya sebagian yang sampai di Ukraina. Selain itu terlihat pula dari tingginya upaya teror dan penembakan terhadap lawan politiknya. Mungkinkah mereka takut diaudit...???\n",

      "How about a debate where each candidate has their own set of questions for the other and they themselves ask the question. The moderators would just be there to be time keepers…allowing the same amount of time back and forth, tell them when time was up and when the next question was, along with a mic silence to stop them from talking over each other. This way the opponents can grill the other and not allow the other to skirt around the question. This also greatly reduces the likelihood of the candidates knowing what questions would be asked of them and would show what topics are important to them. kamala would be destroyed.\n",

      "Kamala needs to go ALL THE WAY IN ON TRUMP, and compare her views as opposed to his.. stop being nice.. treat this like a battle rap put him to sleep\n",
      "The silence on the right everytime hypocritical and false information was spat out from the left. You can tell it has grown on him. What a colossal failure from the left. No backing up, no truth and no respect. Can't even answer questions 😭 It's terrifying . Almost like everyone is going against Trump as a logical, polite and respectful American. But we know that this is all part of Gods will and plan, that \"For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.\" 2nd Cor. 4:17 meaning that God is putting us through these hard tims to prove to us that there is something far greater that he opened to us through His suffering on the cross. Believe in Jesus and trust him in all your works. Do not back down for: \"Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.\"\n",

      "Ok, you want to know what a racist agenda is? If you're watching this and you don't see it you had better open up your eyes. Number one the Haitian immigrants in Springfield \"are not illegal\". Springfield requested them to immigrate 2/3 time because they had a 30,000 Delta population drop since the 90s. There are vacant houses, vacant apartment buildings, and the loss of tax revenue. 15000 Haitians came to Springfield in 2020. They shop at the supermarket, there kids go to the local schools, they go to the local churches, they work in the local industries. You know just like anybody else that moves to a new place. Now here is the racist trope that is the norm throughout American history. He made an unfounded claim about them eating people's pets and look like a complete moron during the debate. Then he turned around and now it went from eating pets to raping and sodomizing your daughters? Those scary immigrant black men deflowering your daughters 🤨 do they do that before or after they eat the family dog 🤔. Sensations are black are they taking black jobs 🤔. Do I believe that somebody in Springfield started that meme about Haitians eating pets? Yes very recently a Haitian man wrecked into the back of a school bus, this caused the injury of 25 kids and the tragic death of one. Springfield is predominantly white it always has been. People moved out and didn't move back so the average age is like 65. There's not really a whole lot there. There's a dollar tree, a wendy's, KFC, a gas station and a tractor supply in a Goodwill. There are a few manufacturing plants... but that's about it. There's only about 60,000 residents plus the 15000 \"legal\" immigrants. Now when the accident happened, the man responsible got 12 years convicted for manslaughter. But then you have racist people in every community and it only takes one. Trump is a piece of s***. What he does is give you a boogie man. He gives you a reason to hate regardless if that's something even exists. Then he points a finger in a group that is not like you. So why does he do that? It is because hate is the strongest emotion that we have. It is also the easiest State of mind to manipulate someone. In 2015 during his campaign it was Mexicans. End of the campaign it was Hillary. Then it was China. Then it was black lives matter protesters. After the debate it was Haitians eating your pets. What I said was by the time we get closer to the election it's going to be cannibal immigrants living in the sewer eating alligators...😳. I was wrong he went right to Jim Crow era racist propaganda and now Haitians are raping and sodomizing your daughters 😳. Every time he points the finger violence ensues. There were a group of proud boys in Springfield today, marching and saying some racist s***. Wish I would have known about it while it was happening. Trump is a piece of s***. Do sloppy, he's slow,, he's dim-witted, he's racist, if you can't see that, that says more about you than anyone else. If you don't see anything wrong with what he says in the path of mental bread crumbs that he is leaving... It's probably because you're the same as him, and that is not a compliment, I can't think of a worse thing to say about someone.Let's be clear, his slogan \"make America great again\"? Let him just be honest for once and is f**** life and call it what it is, \"make America HATE again\".Republicans could have had back anyone and the GOP chose this POS as their candidate 🤦🏻... But it was going to be DeSantis or Trump, same smell, same look, sitting in the same toilet bowl... It would not have made a difference. Sad part is they're actually good Republicans out there that you could have nominated, supported and backed. And you don't want to go with this piece of s***🤬?F Trump. Those scales are going to balance. And I'll let you in on a little secret the GOP doesn't want Trump to be president they want Vance to be president because Vance will do what he's told. Problem is nobody would vote for Vance cuz nobody knew who the hell he was until a few years ago. But you get Trump on the same ticket and something happens to Trump and ..I'm thinking final destination moment. There's already been two strikes. Does it matter what he does from here on out there's going to be more.\n",

The question is: Do the American people truly understand what has happened over the past three years under Biden and Harris (the ‘Kalamazoo copycat’)? They have damaged American society, dismantled its foundations, and contributed to global chaos, empowering terrorist organizations and creating turmoil. In the first debate with Trump last week, the ‘Kalamazoo copycat’ delivered only empty rhetoric, flip-flopping on her positions, while continuing the same lies and corruption that defined her time in California.I also agree with former President Donald Trump—there’s no point in wasting time with the Kalamazoo copycat in a second-round debate, orchestrated by the mainstream media’s fake news outlets like ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN. These liberal media channels are anti-Trump and are working to sabotage your 2024 presidential campaign. In fact, the liberal mainstream media has fueled more chaos, violence, hatred, and division in American society than ever before, especially since the Obama years, 2016, and beyond.

      "Per ABC staffer: I have worked for ABC news for over 10 years in various technical and administrative positions. Since the acquisition of ABC news in 1996, I have observed significant transformations in the nature of news reporting at the organization. These changes suggest a shift from unbiased reporting to a model influenced by external factors. For the record, I do not endorse Donald Trump in his capacity as candidate for President of the United States. The intent of this affidavit is to address concerns regarding percieved biases within news reporting within my employer’s debate that will be hosted on September 10, 2024. The Harris campaign received particular accommodations, including, but not limited to, the providing of a podium significantly smaller than that used by Donald Trump, and assurances regarding split-screen television views that would favorably impact Kamala Harris’s appearance relative to Donald Trump. It was agreed that Donald Trump would be subjected to fact-checking during the debate, while Kamala Harris would not face comparable scrutiny. This was widely known throughout the company that Donald Trump would be fact checked. In fact, various people were assigned to fact check observations it was perceived candidate Trump would make during the debate. In fact, Harris campaign required assurances that Donald Trump would be fact checked. This was done via multiple communications with the Harris campaign whereas the Trump campaign was not included in the negotiations. To my understanding, any rules negotiations and conversations pertaining to the debate should have both the Trump and Harris campaign involved, the Harris campaign had numerous more calls regarding the debate rules without the Trump campaign aware or on the call. The Harris campaign was provided with sample questions that, while not the exact questions, covered similar topics that would appear during the debate. Furthermore, the Harris campaign-imposed restrictions on the scope of questioning, including: No questions regarding the perceived health of President Joe Biden. No inquiries related to her tenure as Attorney General of San Francisco. No questions concerning her brother-in-law, Tony West, who faces allegations of embezzling billions of dollars in taxpayer funds and who may be involved in her administration if elected. Internal Organizational Climate: I have observed a pronounced bias against Donald Trump within ABC news. Employees expressing favorable views towards him experience significant concerns about potential retribution. Purpose and Documentation of Affidavit: This affidavit is executed to document and provide transparency regarding the issues of fairness and impartiality in the debate process and broader concerns about journalistic integrity at ABC News. Additionally, for further investigation, I have secretly recorded several conversations that will prove that the Harris Campaign insisted upon not only the Fact Checking of Donald Trump, but also insisted on what questions were not to be asked under any circumstances or else the Harris campaign would decline to participate in the debate. I have sent a certified letter to Speaker Mike Johnson, dated Sept 9th, 2024, to establish a record that the correspondence was sent before the debate commenced.\n",

Unfortunately most under 40’s now think capitalism is bad and that it’s the reason for the disparity in wealth when in fact it’s the exact opposite. Communism causes the huge disparity in wealth. The middle classes are eliminated with a communist government, everyone has exactly the same, just slightly more than nothing while only a select few are very wealthy. Capitalism provides a ladder for people to climb, with communism there is no ladder, you’re either massively wealthy or poor. Why do you think all the wealthy celebrities are ok with endorsing communism? Because they’ve already made their fortunes and won’t be affected. PLEASE SEE SENSE AND VOTE TRUMP TO SAVE CAPITALISM AND YOUR CHANCE TO CLIMB THE LADDER IN LIFE.\n",

      "Since the mods didnt do it I fact-checked both:Harris stated she wasn't trying to take our firearms Fact-check 1: Kamala Harris expressed support for a mandatory gun buyback program in 2019 Trump believes in better control of who is purchasing. Harris stated there was no agenda for late term abortion Fact-check 2: Multiple states have no restrictions on it, a woman can find out late that her child has mental or physical defects and terminate the day of in some states i.e. the Virginia governor in 2019 proposed and advocated for late term and in his own words \"have a discussion with the mother on what to do with the 'child' after it is born\" verbatim. Tim Walz also removed reporting requirements for children who were \"botched abortions\" and left to die. Trump believes in the exceptions such as gr*pe but in early term. Harris stated Trump praised white-supremacist calling them fine people Fact-check 3: the rest of that sentence from Trump (you can look it up) was as follows \"I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.\" Trump was speaking on the people protesting the removal of national monuments who were both for and against it. Harris stated Trump organized J6 Fact-check 4: He didn't organize it, he wasn't even there. He was asked to make a statement and he urged them to be lawful and respectful as it is their right to protest (you can still find these tweets) and no one was armed. It went sideways when the ges ta po began beating the protestors which there is video evidence of. Police did die later and of completely unrelated reasons. Kamala however was there and there's recording of Pelosi saying nah to national guard when it got out of hand. Weird... Also note: She said J6 was the worst moment in American history since the CW the eve of the anniversary of 9/11. Extra weird... Harris blamed Trump for the border issues Fact-check 5: Brandon appointed her in control of the border because of the \"surge of people they needed to move\" knowing their was an influx of \"visitors\". There is also video of this. Trump didnt turn down the border law, Republicans refused it because it came with \"deviled details\" that instructed anyone who DOES cross cannot be detained so in essence they were trying to be sneaky and the Center of Immigration reported Bidens deal would do nothing if not make it worse. Trump tried to build a wall, Harris stated it wouldn't do anything to help, now she wants to build the wall all of a sudden. Strange. Bonus: Harris stated all the corrupt politicians that worked for Trump whom he fired now support her. This is true. And Walz family, Harris own father, and a good chunk of the Democrat and Independent party now support Trump creating the Unity Party.\n",

They could’ve held it in the outhouse Porta John, or whatever you might wanna call it Minnie mouse laugh, set her supporters while the rest of the world laughs at all of us like I’ve said before the average American is so addicted to the big propaganda machine that it’s actually mind-boggling the Democratic party has come to this is this Minnie mouse woman and her pixie dust the best candidate that they can put forward for the office of the presidency of the United States of America is a joke in itself.

Silence from the 'moderators.Harris repeatedly tried to link Trump to project 2025, even though he repeatedly said he has nothing to do with it. Another Harris lie. Again, silence from the moderators.Harris claimed that Trump called white supremists and neo-Nazis, fine people in Charlottesville. Yet another Harris lie. When Trump said there are fine people on both sides, he added, \"I'm NOT talking about the white supremists or neo-Nazis because they should be totally condemned.\" No 'fact check from the 'moderators'.Harris claimed she never was against fracking, when there are at least three tapes on youtube that show Harris saying she will eliminate fracking. Where were the fact checkers?She claimed she never promoted ending private health care insurance, when there are tapes on youtube showing her doing that very thing. Where are you 'fact checkers'?That's just a small sample of Harris's numerous lies.The moderators not only didn't call out Harris for her lies, they even promoted lies of their own. They claimed no state allows a baby to die after it is born. Actually there are at least eight states that deny medical care and nourishment to a baby born after a botched abortion. This includes Harris's running mate, Walz, state of Minnesota.The ABC moderators were so obviously 'in the tank' for Harris, even CNN called them out for it.Actually, 74% of those surveyed believe Trump won the debate while only 24% believe Harris won. If Harris had won she wouldn't be begging for a second debate.\n",

      "Since the mods didnt do it I fact-checked both:Harris stated she wasn't trying to take our firearms Fact-check 1: Kamala Harris expressed support for a mandatory gun buyback program in 2019 Trump believes in better control of who is purchasing. Harris stated there was no agenda for late term abortion Fact-check 2: Multiple states have no restrictions on it, a woman can find out late that her child has mental or physical defects and terminate the day of in some states i.e. the Virginia governor in 2019 proposed and advocated for late term and in his own words \"have a discussion with the mother on what to do with the 'child' after it is born\" verbatim. Tim Walz also removed reporting requirements for children who were \"botched abortions\" and left to die. Trump believes in the exceptions such as gr*pe but in early term. Harris stated Trump praised white-supremacist calling them fine people Fact-check 3: the rest of that sentence from Trump (you can look it up) was as follows \"I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.\" Trump was speaking on the people protesting the removal of national monuments who were both for and against it. Harris stated Trump organized J6 Fact-check 4: He didn't organize it, he wasn't even there. He was asked to make a statement and he urged them to be lawful and respectful as it is their right to protest (you can still find these tweets) and no one was armed. It went sideways when the ges ta po began beating the protestors which there is video evidence of. Police did die later and of completely unrelated reasons. Kamala however was there and there's recording of Pelosi saying nah to national guard when it got out of hand. Weird... Also note: She said J6 was the worst moment in American history since the CW the eve of the anniversary of 9/11. Extra weird... Harris blamed Trump for the border issues Fact-check 5: Brandon appointed her in control of the border because of the \"surge of people they needed to move\" knowing their was an influx of \"visitors\". There is also video of this. Trump didnt turn down the border law, Republicans refused it because it came with \"deviled details\" that instructed anyone who DOES cross cannot be detained so in essence they were trying to be sneaky and the Center of Immigration reported Bidens deal would do nothing if not make it worse. Trump tried to build a wall, Harris stated it wouldn't do anything to help, now she wants to build the wall all of a sudden. Strange. Bonus: Harris stated all the corrupt politicians that worked for Trump whom he fired now support her. This is true. And Walz family, Harris own father, and a good chunk of the Democrat and Independent party now support Trump creating the Unity Party.\n",

People who are lying may change their head position, such as tilting it to the side, bowing it down, or jerking it back.• several times, she shook her head left-to-right while she spoke, indicating disbelief in her own words. People subconsciously shake their head \"no\" when they lie. As people lie, their brain knows the words are false, and they shake their head as in \"no.\" When people are telling the truth, they tend to nod up and down as in \"yes\".\n",

      "if you look at trumps playbook it is taken directly from Sun Tsu-“If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected .” The Second line sums up trumps reluctance to engage Harris again. He knows that she is superior in every way, smarter, more clever, better informed, etc. trump wants no part of that so he \"evades' her. he knows that he cannot beat her and his only, and tired, play is to lie. That is trump. trump attacks when his opponent is weak and runs when his opponent is superior. According to his Neice he has always been that way, a bully to weaker kids and running home crying when he is confronted by an equal or better force. In short trump is a classic bully and coward. He tells his minions that 'i got your back' but when asked about his involvement in the capital storming he says, I had nothing to do with that, I just made a speech. He is no hero to the people he runs when challenged instead of showing character. classic trump.\n",
